Used 2x6s for extra stability, 1.5" pvc for chain guides, and ditched the standard arms for a custom mounting design

The guide tubes are an interesting addition. They should help keep the chain from sagging out of line when the sled nears the motor.

Yeah, those tubes are a really cool idea!

I also like the davit for supporting the cord to the router.  Nice addition!

One item on the original design that always looked a little edgy to me was the joints between the arms and the motor support plate.  My gut tells me that the joint is likely to flex, with the mount plate rotating around the long axis of the contact patch.  I have wondered if an extra gusset plate perpendicular to the other two pieces might improve repeatability and get us closer to the 1/64" goal.  Anyone looked at/thought about that?

I agree about extra reinforcement for the motor mounts. I found that they would twist if not enough fasteners were used. The plywood arms of the official finished frame have cutouts that address this, but itâ€™s a consideration for alternative designs.

That was part of my goal, to reduce flex at the motor mounts.  These ones I've made are pretty darn solid, especially with the additional diagonal braces.

My goal with the arm up top is to use stretchy string to recoil the z axis cord as the router moves up the work piece.  I'm having some issues with finding a source for the stretchy string

any hardware/sports store is going to have bungee cords in a lot of different lengths and thicknesses.

note that you should be mindful of hanging anything near the router.... I think the best method would be to devise a means of bundling the power cord, dust removal and z-axis into a bundle hanging to the floor, not suspended above the router.

Never been a big fan of mc master prices.  Figured a local hardware store or crafts store would have some, but no luck

Made a small mood today, was having issues with chain alignment on one side still.  Made this small alignment roller out of a 1/2" bolt and 1/2" pc, can be adjusted in and out with shims [IMG_20170702_184201869](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:pVhO:img_20170702_184201869.jpg.jpg)

if you make a roller like that and put it up on the motor support arm so that it forces the chain to be wrapped around the sprocket more, that will also help (bar posted a picture of this, and it's a change from the original plans, but is now recommended for new builders) just make sure that the chain won't hit itself when the sled goes to the bottom corner nearest the motor.

@davidlang we're including that roller in the kit we're sending out next week, and all the beta testers will get a mini kit of all the parts we've changed including the roller

The rollers will help if the chain jumps while the router is traveling away from the motor. I had the opposite and found that the motor mount had skewed. I straightened it and added more fasteners to solve it.

Posted on **2017-07-02 20:39:20** by **scottsm**:

The newest arm design should handle both conditions - look at all those fasteners!

Hahah, I think I added all of those are your suggestion :-)

Couldn't a cheap derailleur be used on a swivel mount? Be used on the active side of the sprocket to force the chain to make optimum wrap/contact with the drive sprocket as 2davidlang mentioned. They really don't cost much and usually can be found for free on used MTB's
I  mean the kit is using the most common and cheapest chain size on the planet, right?
Might need to add a Torsion Spring to the swivel to aid in propper alignment. Though i feel the Sled would help accomplish that. Heck the swivel might not even be necessary.

I messed around with that, but you only gain about one tooth worth of extra contact before getting in the way of the chain when it's at the bottom corners of the sheet.

Didn't figure that was with anything, as it is with pulleys/belts

the type 25 chain used here is smaller than bike chain 1/4" vs 1/2" per link
