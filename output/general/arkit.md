Guys, check it out.  We are going to be able to measure with our phones' camera and generate drawings in our CAD programs.  Soon, anyway.

two questions

1. Is this real or a made-up demo video?

2. If it is real, do you know of the equivalent Android project?

I believe it is real, but...what do I know.  I don't know of any equivalents, but I suppose it must be the next thing everywhere.  "Augmented reality" apps that can sense planes through optics and integrate into software.

Interesting. Not sure that drawing would be useful for anything other than an estimate of flooring sq. ft. I guess useful if you need to order tile? 

I recentely tried the 3d Scanner from Occipital (https://smile.amazon.com/Occipital-Structure-Sensor-bracket-iPad/dp/B016LPM94C/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1500225120&sr=8-9&keywords=3d+scanner). Pretty disappointed, but I didn't spend a lot of time to really try to finesse results.

I recently was at a job where the flooring guys used a small string based thing to plot the whole floor into cad so they could cut flooring.  That's one application I see.  Patterns in boats and odd spaces, etc.
