## Harbor Freight Router
Posted on **2017-02-08 20:34:52** by **tjdux**:

Hi money is pretty tight for me and I know many folks hate HF tools but it may be my only option for now.  I would like the rigid r22 but HF has 2 plunge routers, one for 89.99 and one for 79.99 that can both be bought with their famous 20% off coupons making the cheaper one $100 cheaper than the rigid.  Plus I already own one and it certainly gets the job done for me.



Anyone see any problems using it?  Also will the screw plunge work with the z axis kit and will there be a coupler availible that fits it?



This is the cheaper one and doesn't have screw height adjustment so probably will not work with z axis

This is the more expensive one and looks like it will work with z axis. I don't have this one. Anyone know if it will work?

I have the second one, the adjustment screw is fixed to the base and what you have it a nut with a long plastic knob. coupling the nut to the Z axis wouldn't be easy, and I find that the nut doesn't turn well (I find I need to move the router so the nut is not engaged, turn the knob to set the height, then let the router move back against the nut)



All this said, the test that Bar did last week of cutting the full depth in a single pass shows that for a lot of things you can probably get away without using the Z axis. I suspect that you will be able to cut full depth with the router you have. you won't be able to cut tabs, but you can arrange your depth so you don't quite cut through and then cut from the other side with a flush trim bit to separate all the parts (you need to look carefully at how the router would move from one part to another when creating the part, but it's doable)

Thanks for the info on that second router.  I may just make mine work for now and get the rigid or something compensable when I can.  I really want z axis capibility so I don't have to babysit the machine as much.  I also really want z axis to possibly drill pilot holes for some projects.

I think that sounds like a sensible plan. When I started the project buying an expensive router wasn't something I could afford. I ended up picking up an old one up at a flea market and using it for a while gave me a better sense of what I wanted.  



Another option which might give you good performance cheaply but with some time commitment would be to build a z-axis assembly which would hold and raise and lower your existing router. I have seen some designs posted here in the forums which looked really good using drawer slides and threaded rod. 



I expect that the community will do a much better job of testing and reporting on which routers are the best and the cheapest than I ever could.

Hey thank you for replying Bar.  It's great how you the leader of this community take so much time to reply and talk to everyone you can.  I truly appreciate that.
