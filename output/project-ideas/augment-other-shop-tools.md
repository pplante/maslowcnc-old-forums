## Augment Other Shop Tools

I've been thinking a lot about how to make Maslow make the rest of my woodworking easier/better, etc.

A sort of obvious use that I thought of fairly early on was push sticks. I've never found one that really fit my hand well and gave me the warm and fuzzy I like to have around spinning finger eaters and cutting those things out by hand with a scroll or band saw is just soul-sucking. (Can you tell I have little to no patience?) With Maslow I can throw a dozen designs up on a layout and maybe I can finally find one that I like. https://woodgears.ca/table_saw/pushsticks.html

That got me to thinking about other jigs, fixtures, etc that sometimes require fairly intricate and accurate cuts, many of which you already have to have a jig or fixture for!

First on the list is probably a spline cutting jig; I'm intrigued by this rarely-used joining method; it seems dead simple and makes for great looking joints.

Yeah, I'm already thinking about a cross-cut sled and maybe even a whole new fence/table set up for my table saw.

And here I was thinking Maslow gave me nearly free layout patterns for my blacksmithing shop, but I had not even thought about prototyping tools yet! 

I was thinking that any design that I want to build in metal I can throw it on the maslow then transfer it to my layout table in chalk, I can now repeat at will whenever I need that design again. kinda amazing for someone who plays with hot metal to have lightweight durable patterns.

I plan to ise it to cut sheet aluminum to be used for vacuum forming molds using hot plastic among other things

Vacuum forming! Awesome! I watched an episode of Mythbusters last night where Adam vacuformed a bunch of molds for jello brains. I thought to myself... awesome Halloween idea!
