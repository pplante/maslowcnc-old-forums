## Helpful for new F360 Users
Posted on **2017-05-09 06:31:38** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

Julie Kumar at Autodesk published a series of videos for beginner users of Fusion 360 aimed at CAD/CAM for CNC routing.



The lessons take you from design to cutting for a tablesaw pushstick.



I've watched a few of the videos and I've found them helpful... as a user of Sketchup who is not at all comfortable in F360, it's been great.

A side note: if you end up using these videos to make the push stick, don't use the push stick at your table saw... push sticks of this type (where your hand is surrounded) aren't all that safe.
