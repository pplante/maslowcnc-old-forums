## So many questions!

Hi all,
I run a small furniture business in the west of Ireland and love this setup. Just trying to justify getting one.
A few q's,
Is there an ideal angle of the main board? Is it proportionate to the weight of the router?
Does a less steep angle mean less vibration/cutter chatter?
I know a lot depends on the material, machine and cutter, but what is your finish like on the cut edges on something like Birch ply? (closeup pic?)
Can you tell us how long your logo took to cut in real time?

Thanks

Thank you!

I love the west of Ireland :-) Connemara is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been.

I'm a little hesitant to recommend our machine for a production type situation because it is quite a bit slower than a big commercial machine. Our logo took about 45 minutes to cut I believe. I have heard some people suggest using Maslow to cut templates for furniture and then replicate the templates quickly using a pantarouter (is that the right word?).

I'm away from the garage for the next two days, but I will try to get some close ups of the edges of pieces which we've cut when I get back. The edges look basically like something cut with a router ;-)

I'm not sure about the optimal angle, that's a great question. I tried a couple angles and didn't notice a big difference. I chose the angle of the machine more based on saving space, than any calculations. Fully vertical won't work because you don't get enough force pushing down on the router, but ~20-~45 degrees seemed to me to give similar performance. 

I'm excited to know that someone in Ireland is looking!

Thanks for the reply. I wouldn't be using it for production, probably one off unusual items and crafts.

Another question. .. For those without the space for an 8x4, how small a setup can be done? Could someone build it at say, 4x2, to sit on a bench? Would making the chains shorter increase the resolution?

That's a good question. You can certainly build the machine smaller, the software allows you to enter any dimensions you would like. 

To be able to reach the edges of the sheet, the motors need to be mounted out from the sides and above the top of the sheet so while you can reduce the size of the work area to be as small as you want, the overall size of the machine will still be work area + arms. 

I wouldn't expect the resolution to be better on a small machine, but I wouldn't expect it to be worse either. Most of the limiting factors for the resolution come from the sled not the chains, so I wouldn't expect to see a huge difference.

Question about tabs.
I assume I  would draw these in to my original plans for whatever is being made, or is there an easy "add tabs" setting in your software? 
Or is there an option to finish every cut at the top so the workpiece drops away from the cutter?

You would add tabs in the software where you are setting up the cut not in our software, but it is quite easy to do. Check out www.makercam.com to play around with how it works.

Do you  think a laser diode could be fitted to the mount in place of the router to make an engraver? Or is this a major no no?

Maslow is an open source project; whether it's a no-no or not is up to your level of comfort with the project as you implement it.

That being said, I think you would have your hands full working out a good pulsewidth that would work for the relatively slow sled. 48" per minute is slow compared to most laser engravers.

@Jamesbil do you know what router you're going to apply to this? 
Had a quick look and couldn't see where the recommended one could be bought in the Uk/Ireland?

Yeah, Rigid is not available here, I was thinking of using a 1/4 inch makita, http://www.axminster.co.uk/makita-rt0700cx2-router-trimmer-1-4-ax875577
If it's heavy enough.

I would worry more about the small base plate than the weight (You can always add another brick :-)). I'm a little worried that the sled could be less stable with a smaller base-plate. I haven't tired one yet, so I could be wrong. You can always make yourself a larger base plate too.

It would be easy enough to add a larger base plate. Something like a universal Trend one.
Do you think the makita I linked would work with the z axis lift?
