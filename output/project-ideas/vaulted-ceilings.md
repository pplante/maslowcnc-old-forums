## vaulted Ceilings

I just had the craziest realization! two years ago we moved into a house that I rebuilt from the studs. In the master bedroom I created a barreled ceiling (Here's a picture of it while we were still under construction: https://goo.gl/photos/YCcbpMpTfKLVZU2V9 ) and let me tell you, it was a frustrating feat of engineering to measure, cut and place each of the handmade "ribs". 
Today, like a bolt out of the blue! I realized Maslow would have made this process stupidly easy!! Then I realized it would take almost no extra engineering to create a double barreled ceiling like this (technically a "groin vault"): https://www.google.com/search?q=groin+vault&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjag5b3lszSAhUJ5oMKHcKzDTsQ_AUIBigB&biw=1366&bih=638
Man, having a low cost, large format, CNC router opens up so many opportunities.

At that is exactly why we are all here and waiting for the MaslowCnc. We all have a ton of ideas that could be done with the MaslowCNC. We all see improvements and ideas that will make life easier for implementing on a large scale.

FYI, the realization came to me when I saw this house's kitchen. At first glance I thought, "dang! That's complex" and then thought, "wait.... I could do this!!!"  [IS6af4no4vetfo0000000000](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s2/:maslowcnc:OGDE:is6af4no4vetfo0000000000.jpg.jpg)

I see a hobbit hole made with Maslow in someone's future...
