## CAD models for Hardware added

There was a request (I can't find it now) for detailed CAD models of the hardware mounting brackets, so I've added them to the [Mechanics](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics) repository on GitHub. Each model has dimensions added  [like so](../../images/Xm/AR/XmAR_bracket.jpg.jpg) .
