## Automated Machine Calibration Shape
Posted on **2017-07-04 14:05:34** by **jenmsuth**:

Hey all, 



For some reason when I run the automated test shape, the software does not stop moving the router when prompted to adjust z-axis. This is similar to the issue that I brought up earlier, except that it only does this within the automated calibration routine. Outside of the calibration routine, if I test with the standard circle/square everything worked like a charm. Only now I can't remember which settings to adjust if I have a vertically elongated shape...

Hi Jenmsuth, the distance of the chain mounts on the sled, is what you can tweak. Also don't remember up or down, but two test cuts with the same variation + or - will give the answer

Here's a [picture](/images/4k/4kho_tuningcalibration.jpg.jpg) which should help, but the bigger issue is why isn't it stopping to let you adjust the z-axis.



Is anyone else seeing the same behavior?

The automated process is really so much less painful than doing it by hand. I know I did a calibration without the z-axis over the weekend as part of updating the assembly instructions, but I can't remember if I had to fix anything about that. It's possible that this week's software update will fix the issue

Hey Bar - never found a solution to the z-axis - it still refused to stop to allow the adjustment. Does it assume that I have an automatic Z-axis?



I decided to run the auto-calibration routine with my bit set at 1/16" so that it just etched the whole operation. I got everything set up great and ran a test cut, which turned out beautifully.

Great work around! I'm stumped as to what's going on. I tried to get the same issue to happen by doing the calibration with the manual z-axis and mine stopped at the appropriate places. So it stops when running a program, but not during the calibration process?

Yeah...it's very strange. I may try it again when my Z-axis arrives - I have to recalibrate anyway with my final assembly. Maybe that will make a difference. 



But, as is I was able to use it perfectly to cut all my frame parts - no hiccups.
