Curious how people are mounting the electronics to the back of the cnc frame? Anyone have any pics/references? Thx in advance!

Mine are above because they benefit more from the window AC blowing parallel to the worksheet.   [IMAG0788](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:m5PK:imag0788.jpg.jpg)

Thanks for the pic, and how did you mount the board to the ply? Velcro or double stick tape?

Yes I used Velcro, works great!  Was planning on Maslowing a box for it with a fan installed in one side to blow across the motor control fins.

I used brass pcb distance screws, sorry I don't know the name for them. Not all of the Arduino pre-drilled holes can be used, but 3 worked.

This is one of the things that we are going to be shipping out to all the beta testers, because we realized we were missing it. I used small nylon spacers and screws to attach the board to the back of the machine, and we will be sending the spacers and screws we use to everyone.
