## Ridgid R22002 vs R29302 router (Canada?)
Posted on **2017-06-22 09:55:00** by **jmoes**:

I am shopping for a new router in preparation for receiving my Maslow in coming weeks. At Home Depot Canada, the router they carry is identified as R29302 (https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/p.heavy-duty-2hp-router-combo-kit.1000663450.html). It looks identical to the R22002. Can anyone confirm that the R29302 is essentially the same as the R22002, or are there differences I should be aware of?
Thanks

The R29302 is a combo kit that includes a router, plus fixed and plunge bases. The router is definitely the R22002, but rated at 2.25hp (R22002 is usually marketed as a "2hp" model) Not sure why.

You can compare part numbers for the crucial pieces here: [R29302](http://www.ereplacementparts.com/ridgid-r29302-heavy-duty-2hp-router-combo-kit-parts-c-7929_8229_167789.html) and [R22002](http://www.ereplacementparts.com/ridgid-r2200-heavy-duty-2hp-router-combo-kit-parts-c-7929_8182_167782.html).
