## Ridgid R2200 Tips from a Review
Posted on **2017-04-09 05:28:06** by **jwolter0**:

Getting ready to buy our Ridgid R2200 in anticipation of our kit, I was browsing the reviews of it on the Home Depot website. One user complaned that a reaction between the motor portion and the base portion caused significant corrosion, and that the bit was hard to change. Another user suggested wiping the motor housing with paste wax, which prevents corrosion and allows it to move more smoothly. They also suggested replacing the stock chuck with a product called a musclechuck.

I have no idea if either of these suggestions is useful in the MaslowCNC context, but thought I'd share them just in case.

Wow, that looks like a huge improvement, particularly when the router is sled or table mounted.  Thank you for sharing those tips.
