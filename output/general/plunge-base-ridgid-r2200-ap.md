## Plunge base Ridgid R2200 apparently no longer available.

Apologies if this has been asked and answered. 
I was going to grab my dedicated router before ordering the Z axis kit, With the Plunge base Ridgid R2200 apparently no longer available, do you have any suggestions on currently available routers?

Isn't this the one you need?

http://www.homedepot.com/p/RIDGID-2-HP-1-2-in-Corded-Fixed-Base-Router-R22002/202739521

If you look at the pictures it shows the depth adjustment. Can someone confirm before I order?

Thanks.

You want the fixed base router, not the plunge base.  The one in the link above is correct.

+1 @mattnelson and @chauhuh you want the fixed base version and the link is correct

Thanks all, I had it in my head it needed to be a plunge for the in/out axis.

I did too. I'm not certain why that is. The one you listed has the lock on the side and the whole body slides. That doesn't seem quite right.

The Home Depot lists the plunge base for that router as discontinued by Ridgid. What's the setup for the plunge function. If the clip is disengaged to allow the router to slide and the z is attached (how?), will that one point of attachment and a loose base collar not cause some issues with precision and independent router movement?

The way I made it work is to set the tension on the locking mechanism to be tight enough to prevent wobble, but loose enough to still allow the router to move. There may be a better way, but that was the simplest way I could figure out to do it. I automated the motion on the router I already had so there may be other ways to do it. 

From playing around with routers in the hardware store it seemed to me like the cheaper plunge routers had at least as much play in the unlocked state as a fixed base version with the clasp adjusted. The high end plunge routers seem pretty darn good even when unlocked. If you have a hunch about a better way to do it, go for it! I fully expect that almost every part of the design will be improved by the community pretty quickly.

Bar - The R2200 in the link above says that it doesn't have any dust collection, but I thought I remember seeing in the original video that the Rigid router you were using had good dust collection.  Is that the same router that you have?

That is very strange. Maybe they mean that the dust collection is not internal, but that you can connect a dust collector. Mine has a a fitting for a vacuum hose which is used to suck out the dust.

Yeah that's really weird because I don't see any dust collection port or fitting in any of the pictures. Hmm..

One of the side viewing windows is removable and replaceable with a 1-1/4" dust port.  Here is a link to the parts breakdown that shows the piece.

Ryobi router.... I looked at that one in detail. It's yucky. The whole case is plastic! PLASTIC LEAD SCREW!!! Verry hard to turn. It's gonna wear out -fast-. I got the impression the only metal in it was the copper motor windings. (I actually have a few Ryobi yard equipment items that aren't junk. (Except for the leaf blower (which came free with another item) that has the blow power of an emphysematic sloth.)) That router is the Easy Bake Oven of the home shop tool world. I wouldn't expect more than a few hours run time out of it.

Question related to the z-axis - Can anyone provide some pictures of the two things to measure on their router, so they can confirm what z-axis package to purchase? Like, where would I put my calipers on my router base to take the measurement?

I've dis-assembled my plunge bases in the past to set up an aftermarket router lift, and there's usually two different measurements needed to enable the hex key lift - 1 for the shaft diameter, and 1 for the "headspace" above the shaft for the lift assembly. I assume z-axis is similar here.

Posted on **2017-03-03 13:51:16** by **davidlang**:

the diameter of the screw shaft diameter is the only criteria to worry about when selecting a Z axis kit, there aren't different motors provided so the headspace measurement wouldn't let you pick anything different.

I haven't seen any dimensions of the Z axis motor provided, but since the motor can go on the end of the shaft away from the workpiece, space should not be an issue there.

Thanks, that is helpful. So basically the axis has a clamping collar that attaches itself to the existing adjustment screw shaft for a non-plunge (or a plunge without the spring remaining) router base? That makes more sense. I know some of my routers have something like this, but other bases wouldn't make sense here.

One detail. It's been mentioned that a plunge base is what you definitely don't want. Fixed bases have adjustments. They're fairly precise, and strong enough to lift the whole router motor. Plunge bases have screws that limit downward travel and that's it. They're very lightweight and typically -not- attached to the base at the bottom end of the screw which is required to push the router motor in both directions. That last point is required for this 'very angled' router orientation.
HOWEVER if you -do- know of a plunger with some sort of adjustment screw attached at both ends that may be suitable for Maslow then please add it to the wiki router list.

the Z axis has brackets to attach the motor to the plywood base. The output shaft of the motor needs to be attached to whatever adjusts the height of the router.

Plunge routers do not have anything suitable to attach to. Fixed base routers (that you can loosen the clamp on) frequently (but not always) have something suitable to clamp to. watch the youtube video about this topic  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Kv3GZI6Og
