I have 1 1/2 HP Ryobi 163 fixed based router. Will this be a problem?

Thanks.

That router should work great. I haven't been used one yet, but I played with one in the store and it seemed like a great router.

Just measured and the height adjustment shaft with the knob removed is .500 inches on the digital calipers.
