Are there any plans to test these after they arrive from the supplier but before they ship?   Guessing you won't have time to test a thousand plus and make that ship date.  What about replacing ones that don't work?

Last minute supplier delays aren't unusual, but between it being a new product and a new supplier there's the chance that they'll have forgotten to secure the magic smoke in all of the board.  There will probably be be some that let the smoke out.

Yes! 

We won't have time to test all of them, but we will test 100 or so to make sure that we're not seeing a significant number of bad ones
