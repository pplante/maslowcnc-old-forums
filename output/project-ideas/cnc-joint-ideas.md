After watching the videos here I started researching build ideas and ran across this website. It explains the strengths and weaknesses of CNC cut joints, plus offers a lot of (really beautiful) ideas on how to make good quality joints. Thought you might like to see it as well: http://mkmra2.blogspot.com/2014/08/cnc-cut-wood-joinery.html

One of the projects I'm planning for Maslow is related to our hardwood flooring; the Ginkgo Scarf with Stub Tenon joint looks like a really neat way to join the ends! Thanks for that resource!

@TheRifelsSpiral - Yes! There are some beautiful exposed joining techniques listed. I keep thinking I'd want to hide the joints, but if done correctly they certainly can be a visual element.
