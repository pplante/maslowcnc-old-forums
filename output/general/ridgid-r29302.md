## Ridgid R29302

Hey folks, this is the model Homedepot.ca sells in Canada. R29302. To me it looks very similar to the r2200. My main concern is that the ridgid z axis attachment with the kit works with this model. Any one have any experience or indications? If not maybe I'll be the test subject. Steep price though. Or I could source one from over the border.

That is the combo kit that includes a plunge base as well as a fixed base, you will want to use the fixed base with the maslow.



it's the correct router, but you are paying for the extra base you don't need.

Thanks David. I just picked it up since it's my only option here. [Image](/images/v4/v4x3_image.jpg.jpg)
