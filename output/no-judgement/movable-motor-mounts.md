## Movable motor mounts

Just wondering if any of the beta testers have looked at cutting any material that is thick i.e. a large piece like https://www.woodtalkonline.com/topic/25693-pecan-slice-sign-cnc/ and if so would the motor mounts have to be moved forward?

it depends on exactly how thick that is, but the answer is probably 'yes'

although, I'd seriously consider cutting a hole in the plywood that's the frame and just having that stick through to the correct height. If the hole is fairly centered, you can cut a pretty large one without loosing too much stiffness, and if you run with a backer board normally (to avoid cutting the frame), it shouldn't matter that there's a hole there (and worst case, buy a new sheet of plywood and re-attach the arms and legs :-)

I'm thinking of a project like that too. If I extend the motor mounts I'll need to make sure they're stable and to arrange some scrap around the workpiece to support the sled. That's solved if I inset it into the frame, but I'm concerned about losing stiffness of the frame. I'll be interested to hear what approach you choose and how your project goes.

If you are planning to do this when you build the frame, I would build the frame of the 'wall style' where you have a rectangular from of 2x4s with the plywood on top of that. You can make such a thin much stiffer by adding a thin layer of plywood to the back (turning it into a torsion box)

I've been thinking of this too.  I was sketching out a pivot for the motor mount to self adjust to wood thickness.  I will try and make this a real life test soon.

Great feedback, it will be a while before I get to tackling a job like that, but always good to start thinking about the end result before you build something and then might have to tear it apart to make an other idea work :)
