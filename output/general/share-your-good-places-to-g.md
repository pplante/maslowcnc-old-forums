I'd love to experiment with materials besides the few types of plywood offered at hardware stores. Here are some tips on where to buy sheet goods. Please feel free to share. 

Google cabinet suppliers or call custom cabinet makers , they have more unique plywood, like Baltic birch, maple, and hundreds of veneers in stock. I've gotten sheets of 1/8" thin Baltic birch, bendable plywood and other goods that one would never find at home depot. 



Likewise google plastic distributors for a wide range of plastic sheet goods. Polycarbonate, acrylic, pvc board, abs, painted aluminum, HDPE are all common plastics you might find on a cnc.  For best price always ask for a price for a quantity of 100 and then a single sheet for you to test out. They take you more seriously that way, Customers that only order 1 sheet can be annoying.  I like these 2

and www. piedmontplastics.com



Aluminum is a soft metal that can be cnc cut. I use www.easternmetals.com and www.americanmetals.com Since it's a commodity the p rice fluctuates with the market but it is currently about $2 a pound for most common shapes. most people think it's expensive but it's typically cheaper than hardwood boards. Alro.com is also a nation wide distributor who sells mostly steel and plastic sheet goods. 



For really weird materials you will probably have to order them online. Carbon fiber sheets. 



I'd really like to find a supplier of bamboo or plyboo in 1/4 or 1/2" thickness anyone know of one?

forgot to mention a lot of of these distributors have cnc saws and can cut the sheets down to size for free or a small cost. makes handling it a lot easier.

Thanks for sharing. Can't have too many cool places to buy new materials from. Dixieply.com stocks plyboo in the Atlanta,GA area. One my favorite places to browse is an airplane builders supply store. They have aircraft grade aluminum and plywood sheets, carbon fiber and balsa wood.  http://m.aircraftspruce.com/categories/building_materials/bm/menus/wp/plywood.html

I use Sintra which is PVC board for building cosplay armor. I've gotten it from a local sign shop.
