## The radius or diameter of current sled please

Sorry I can't wait for the pressures parcel to arrive. I would like to cut the sled with a circular jig, just to be ready. On my Ubuntu the Github svg does not open in inkscape for some reason, I'm not even sure I could get the dimensions out of it. The Skechup I had running has expired. Searching for "sled" in this forum also did not help me. Kindly help me out.

You are looking for a radius of 218mm. The size isn't critical, so +- a few mm shouldn't cause big trouble

Thank you so much! I guess I will be hanging the router on ropes to the corners tonight :-)
