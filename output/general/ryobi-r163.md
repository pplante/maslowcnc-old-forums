## Ryobi R163
Posted on **2017-05-15 11:58:22** by **spyker**:

My Ryobi R163 under the height knob is .500 inches wide, not an option to order with the kit. I need to know what the motor side of the coupler needs to be so I can figure out what coupler to order myself. Are the coupler specs out there somewhere I am not finding? Please feel free to move this post if this isn't the right Channel.

The output shaft on the z-axis motor is 6mm, fortunately 1/4 inch is 6.35mm so you could probably get away with a coupler that is 1/4 inch also.

So I think I end up looking for a 6.35mm to 12.7mm flexible shaft coupler. Looks like all I can find ship on a boat from China...

I'll keep an eye on it too and see if we get other requests for 1/2 inch shafts. If we do we'll get a batch made. I'm surprised it hasn't come up before, it seems like 1/2 inch should be a pretty common size.
