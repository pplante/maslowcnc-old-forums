## Bosch Router adjustment recommendation
Posted on **2017-03-14 07:46:57** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

I just received my Bosch 1617EVSPK  combo kit. I don't actually intend to use this particular router with Maslow, but it's a not-too-costly router that's widely available.



This Bosch router, along with several others I've used, have a recess in the fine adjustment knob into which an extension can be placed. The part number is RA1002 and it's just a 10mm (I think) hex pattern on the end of a shaft with a knob at the end. [RA1002](/images/cF/Ch/cFCh_ra1002.jpg.jpg) 



I'll re-check the dimension tonight to be certain, but I'm thinking it would be easier to couple a 6mm bolt to the Z-axis motor and run this down into the adjustment knob. It looks like it would be a real pain to get that knob off!

I didn't like the idea of backlash and slop added by Yet Another UnSECURED Mechanical Connection, so I didn't like the hex nut idea very much.

In the hex recess at the top of the plastic knob, you can see the end of the axle shaft? There's a flat on the shaft, at it mates with a flat molded bit on the knob?

If yes that's what mine looks like and this worked for me very easily....

Set a vice to about 3/8-1/2" spacing. Don't clamp the axle but set the plastic knob on top of the vice with shaft down between the jaws. The bottom edge of the knob should sit squarely on the vice jaws. Again, don't clamp anything in the vice, all the jaws are doing is supporting the knob squarely and solidly.

With almost any kind of punch, tap-tap-tap and the axle slides out of the knob. OK maybe it takes a 'tap-Tap-TAP.' :)

I said any kind of punch, but I think the axle is hardened steel, so I wouldn't use  a tool like a wood center punch or any normally-wood-related tool. Never know which material is going to 'win' such as blunting a center punch.

If the nut fits tight, where's the added backlash/slop?



And what's the chance that knob will go back on without damaging something?



I'm just not cool with modifying a tool that's not dedicated to a purpose.. Using the RA1002 or a suitable substitute is a way to use this tool without modifying anything.

the nut never fits tight enough to eliminate backlash. It's not a lot, but it can easily be 1/8 of a turn.

What? 1/8 of a turn? No. Not even close.



1/8 of a turn is 45 degrees. A hex shape has facets every 30 degrees. What you're suggesting is that the bolt would have to be smaller, point to point, than the opening is, flat to flat, meaning it would spin inside the socket.



Maybe you meant 1/8 of a turn total (1/16 one direction, 1/16 the other?) Even then, that's 22.5 degrees in one direction meaning you're putting a  9.5mm bolt in an 11mm socket.  [22.5 Degrees](/images/an/bQ/anbQ_davidlang.jpg.jpg) 



The clearance between those parts should be thousandths of an inch... even at 5 thousandths clearance, there would be only about 1 degree of play and that's a very loose fit. [5 thousandths clearance](/images/2J/ND/2JND_davidlang2.jpg.jpg)

By 'SECURED' I meant that anything I can't loctite and walk away from and never look back -- I don't -trust- it. :) There are a couple of things I don't like. 



First is alignment. By design the 'stress train' goes z-motor, coupler, router z-axis axle. Three pieces and two 'interfaces.' That's one driving force, one relay, and one receiver, and they're all metal. The interfaces are where the objects contact. When assembled the interfaces are always by a sturdy positive connection.



To use the nut there needs to also be a threaded rod, so adding two parts to the stress train with the nut. And adding three interfaces. Now the train is z-motor, coupler, threaded rod, nut, knob, axle.



The knob attached to the axle, I'm fine with that. It's NOT coming off by accident. I think that was meant for inverted table-mount router, correct?. The user reaches under the table with that crank handle to adjust the height. The nut in socket doesn't need much accuracy in itself, because the user can feel when the  nut is engaged, and depending on which way he turns it can feel the backlash and knows when he's moving the router.



Which brings up a point, how accurate is the hex centered on the axle? Pretty close, because the knob is a nice high quality piece of molding.



The inaccuracy of the nut on the threaded rod is another slight factor. It's more or less centered and square in the axis.



Those two inaccuracies can be taken up by the coupler, so most likely no real problem. It's 'more stuff' though, to keep an eye on.



Here's the dirt... The nut connection to the knob... Metal <-> plastic connections are frequently not much fun. Further, this is a -motion- -transmitter-! Metal on plastic -moving- connections are VERY not fun. The metal always wins, the plastic wears out fast. Backlash will be clear after, (rough justice guess,) a few hundred full z-axis travels. The nut never presses evenly all around the inside of the hex shape. As the motor rotates the system the metal is constantly sliding against the plastic, at the highest spots. Those high spots will wear off to be more flat, and add backlash because the nut doesn't fit as tight as it used to. 



Yes the nut could be shimmed once in a while.



Now if the plastic is harder, and it lasts thousands of travels before it becomes annoying, maybe it's worth the extra parts/effort. I'd simply prefer to stay away from all of it. (Reaching for bottle of loctite even as I type. ;))



>And what's the chance that knob will go back on without damaging something?



For myself, I wouldn't care. Even if I ever needed the recessed-hex feature for its intended use there are about 4 ways to make another from scratch, or buy the replacement axle/knob assembly. (That's probably not cheap though so yeah that's a risk if it's too difficult for someone to make from scratch.)



>I'm just not cool with modifying a tool that's not dedicated to a purpose.. 



Totally understandable. Go for it as you intend and I hope it works well. If not you're not locked out there are always options.

on lathes, which are built to operate at much tighter tolerances than a router, it's common for there to be several thousandths worth of backlash.

I have the same Bosch 1617 router.  The plastic hex nut end pops off easily after you remove the C-ring and gently tap the shaft out.

The Bosch 1617 is a great tool for this.  They sell bases separately (for router tables) and you can dedicate one to the Maslow so you can easily remove and use this nice router elsewhere when you need.

I have a router table base on the way along with all the dust collection accessories. This is by far the nicest router I've ever owned; my first project is going to be a giant Eurorack for a musician friend of mine. He composes sitting down but records standing up so I designed it so it will tilt as he needs it to.

With all it's curves and recesses it's ripe for CNC but he's re-doing his studio right now and I can't wait on Maslow. I'm planning to build some more so I'll use Maslow for that for sure!

Here's the Explode-O-View of the router base. The knob (known in the parts list as the 'Adjustment Device' :)) is a separate part from the drive axle. It's meant to be replaceable if, for instance, one manages to bonk the knob and break it. https://www.boschtoolsservice.com/Order/IPL/IPLDetails.aspx?tn=2610927569&mn=RA1161&RelatedTools=2610927569;&init=1

LOL "Adjusting Device"... Surely there's a word in German for "knob!"

Adjustment knob would be einstellknopf if I remember right.  Well knob is knopf for sure.  Ahh my wasted youth..
