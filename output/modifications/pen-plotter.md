I'm curious how you think this setup would work as a pen plotter?  This will be used at my school and I can see them using it to make signs on butcher paper.

why not? just replace the router with a pen, of course you will need z axsis control to move pen up and down, otherwise everything you draw ill be connected by a line.

There have also been a couple suggestions to add a second axis so the machine could draw and cut all in one process which would let you label parts and then cut them.
