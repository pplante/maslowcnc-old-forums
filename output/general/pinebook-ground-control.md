Will ground control run on a Pinebook?

I think it should be able to.  Pinebooks run Linux or Android, and I know that groundcontrol runs on Linux, not sure about Android.  Do you already have the Pinebook, and if so, what OS are you running?

I just purchased one, should arrive around the end of May.  I plan to run Linux on it.

They are running a few weeks behind in shipping the maslow kits (they don't want to cut the beta-test period short as it's providing so much value)

people have run ground control on android, on Raspberry Pis, as well as on Windows/Mac/Linux desktops. It's a python app (and you can also use any grbl compatible control program to run the machine)

I would expect it to run well on Linux. Let us know how it goes!
