Nice update.  Nice to see a hurtle not only jumped but smashed.

Can we get a link to the math discussion?

I didn't actually do the math so I can't publish it, but I'll ask Keith I can publish his write up.

Hey @shootquinn Keith did a beautiful write up of the new math, and gave me permission to copy it onto the original stack exchange question where it can be commented on, edited or linked to easily. You can find it here: http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/10607/forward-and-revers-kinematics-for-modified-hanging-plotter

P.S. If anyone wants to up vote the right answer that would be awesome. I can't up vote my own answer, so right now you have to scroll all the way to the bottom to see it
