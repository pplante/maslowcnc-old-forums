## Forum transition
Posted on **2017-07-19 02:08:37** by **davidlang**:

when the link to the forums gets switched, we will have another link back to here, but we want to prevent people from posting here (because we won't have people watching for posts)

We also want to get data out of here and into the new forum.

To do that, we will need to get some volunteers who will go through the various topics here and extract useful info into informational posts on the new forum.

There's lots of topics here that will not need to be copied, as the discussions in them  are completely out of date (a lot of the early troubleshooting, questions about when things will ship, weekly update posts, etc)

But there are a lot of topics here that have good technical information that remains relevant and should be summarized and/or copied over.

There are also many cases where the same thing has come up multiple times, with different information each time, and all these different threads can be consolidated into a single, shorter thread/post

The suggestion is that the volunteers will remain able to post here (possibly be given admin rights) and will add a post to  the end of each topic they have evaluated saying that they don't think it needs to be copied, or that the data has been transferred (with a link to the new thread). If the volunteers have admin rights, it may be easiest to move threads that have been transferred into dedicated channels (one for 'not needed', one for 'summarized') so that others can double-check the works being done.

There are about 700 threads here now, and some of them have a LOT of technical information (some of my infodumps and some of the posts about alternate sled designs for example)

It's probably possible to start triaging the older threads even before we shutdown normal access, but it may confuse things to start doing that.

So, who is up to volunteering to do this sort of thing? I'll do some of it, but there's a lot to do.

I've tried my best to set the Wiki up to be prepared for some of this type of work. Please consider that any 'concrete' info should probably be put there vs copy/paste into forum threads. .

good point, but there is probably still some that is people's plans (which are interesting, but not confirmed) or just staging links and ideas before we are ready to move them to the wiki.

I will gladly volunteer some of my time to help out. I work a lot so I may not have as much free time as some of our other members, but if we need to move some of this information to the new forum or the wiki (as mrfugu is suggesting) I will do what I can. I took a quick look over at the wiki and it looks ready to be filled up! I can't wait to start adding to it!

A couple areas of feedback:
1) Is there a good section for alternate frame designs? I see a header for Alternate size machines. I was planning on trying to dig up MexicanMillionaire's steel frame and add that to the wiki, especially since that was a good starting point for my own steel frame design.

2) Also looking for a CAM section, that way we can move some of our Fusion360 info plus the other programs.

It's entirely possible I'm just looking in the wrong spot for these

meynard, yes to both, its a little odd since the wiki is actually 5 different wikis linked up. 

1) all the headers with [brackets] are potential new pages, paste in the header from another page in that section and go for it.  

2) CAD and CAM pages are linked from here: https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/wiki

er header isnt the right word. point is  these are [pages to be built]

@davidlang agreed, I've been trying to keep only 'confirmed' info in the wiki.

I'm in agreement with MrFugu that answers of a technical nature should rest at the appropriate Wiki pages. Rather than transferring any knowledge from here (old forum) to new, we should transfer that knowledge to a wiki page. My preference would be to have discussion in a forum, conclusions in a wiki.

Regarding frequently asked questions, we can assemble a knowledge base in the pinned topic (sticky) at the top of each Category (called "channels" here).

Those topics are owner-edit only, but are regular threads so anyone can make suggestions for the content at the top-level post.

My suggestion is that any content (links/directions/etc) should be added to the appropriate pinned topic now, and I'll start compiling it into the top-level comment.

(Sorry, I should have said "an Admin or Moderator" instead of "I'll")

One channel I do think we need to duplicate as closely as possible is the "Projects" area. Really cool stuff over there we don't want to loose.

related: the CommunityGarden github wiki is deactivated, there's an issue open to unlock it, but it's not been resolved.

Posted on **2017-07-19 08:18:52** by **mrfugu**:

there are at least 5-6 wiki pages that should be moved there, and I can think of another 4-5 pages off the top of my head. the Community Garden is an excellent place to document some of the 'attempts' at customization, a middle ground between the forum (free experimentation) and the larger wiki (hard data)

---

Posted on **2017-07-19 08:20:38** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

The intent of the Community Garden is to share actual project files. (DXF or SVG) Certainly any customizations to Maslow that the users may want to share can reside there.

Posted on **2017-07-19 09:06:12** by **mrfugu**:

I was referring to the Community Garden Wiki section. (all the other main sections of the wiki are localized to the github repositories they're linked  to.)

I will make getting the google login working on the new forums a priority

The google login should be working now :-)

Quick like a bunny!
