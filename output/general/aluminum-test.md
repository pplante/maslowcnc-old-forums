## Aluminum test
Posted on **2017-04-17 13:53:47** by **rancher**:

Well, while I'm on hold with more detailed projects, I figured I'd do another test for some future projects I've got in mind.  I had to run to town this morning, so I stopped by a local boat builder buddy's shop and picked up a sheet of 5/32 5052.  Using my 1/8" single flute with stepdowns of .010 it cut without issue.  I'm excited.

What! That's amazing! Thanks for testing that. To be honest, I thought there was no way that would work. Great job!

Awesome. All the way through the material? How did the edges and sides look? Do you have a magnifier to look at the steps? Wouldn't it be ironic if it cut aluminum better than plywood? :)

Haha.  Thanks guys!  It actually wasn't very loud, not really much louder than the router/dust combo.  A little louder than the ply.  J, I wasn't able to do a very good test due to the aforementioned problems.  I did cut all the way through in one spot, but I didn't finish the file due to z and tracking issues.  I did go repeatedly around a rectangle, and yes I cut through, but I did not go through everywhere and free a part.  The cut looked good, I think a few minutes with a deburring tool and it would be good enough for my uses.  Certainly after a little more experimenting and tweaking.

Wow, yes.  You have set the safety height to +0.? and it still does not retract?  That's weird.  The rest looks good!

And did the bit scorch?  what speed did you use?

It's not that it doesn't retract.  I have been having strange behavior at the start of the run, although I read what bar wrote today about home then retract then run the code.  I think that was a lot of my problems.  Anyway, due to whatever reason, I had to manually drop the bit into the first cut.  The first cuts always start way high, and I think it's due to some GC thing at the start.  So, I put the bit down, and then it does the step downs, but when it retracts to move, it thinks it's out when it's not.



No, I don't think the bit scorched.  Or, I don't know enough to know.  The shavings were still chippy, not welded though.  Feed was I think 20ipm, router on high I believe.

Awesome Test, I am rebuilding a Beetle, I have some need to cut my own parts.  Very Cool.

I cut aluminum all the time with a 1/8" upcut bit has to be SINGLE flute 

double or triple flutes  cut horribly. 

6061 cuts the easiest. 5000 series is ok, and avoid 3000 series at all costs (diamondplate is usually 3032 alloy) tends to gum up the bit and then break. 

one can cut 1/16 thick sheet metal in one swipe by hand. 



The thing with aluminum is you ironically want to run it as fast as possible. Most people tend to slow it down which gives even worse results.

bar I sent you some aluminum and bits to test a couple of weeks ago, you are probably to busy to test, but try it you will be surprised.

hopefully.

I got them, I've just been so busy! Sorry it's taking me so long!

I just redid this test with a better .nc file and it did very well.  The parts are useable by my standards, and there is still some tweaking to do.  Just wanted to share with others thinking about Maslow for aluminum work.   Exciting!
