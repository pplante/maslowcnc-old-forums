## An interesting read from Maker Faire
Posted on *2017-05-23 12:16:05* by *Bar*

Maker Faire was fantastic. We had a great time meeting so many amazing people from our community. We also made swards for quite a few children while the guys over at CNC router parts made shields.

Our community is as amazing in person as online, and the greater CNC community is pretty awesome also.

One of the many amazing people we had the chance to meed was Bill Young the founder of Shelter2.0 and 100kGarages and he turned me onto this cool article he wrote about [using CNC machines to cut patterns](https://medium.com/@wlyoung/there-are-more-than-just-0s-and-1-s-45b444ff1a31) which can be rapidly replicated to produce shelters (or anything else that's needed) quickly.

I'm back and getting caught up! Thanks again for everyone who came to see us, and another huge thank you to everyone who kept the fires stoked in the forums while I was away!

Details to follow in the update tomorrow.

His [blog post about plywood](http://www.shopbotblog.com/2015/10/my-lovehate-relationship-with-plywood/) is well worth reading, too.

I just read both of Bill Young's articles and I'm thinking there's a Maslow article stuck in his keyboard and wanting to get out.

Hey Bar and Hannah, any chance we migh see you at a Faire east of the Mississippi some time? After a suitable recovery period, of course.

We would love to! Until we get all the bugs worked out / all the boxes packed I think we're hunkering down focusing on those things, but as soon as everything is running smoothly we'd love to get to see more of the country and more of you guys :)
