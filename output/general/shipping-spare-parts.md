## Shipping spare parts
Posted on *2017-05-31 23:26:16* by *edou*

Hello Bar, is there a possibility to include extra parts in the initial shipment? I'd like extra chain links and sprockets. International shipping charges have a high cost for small parts, and the exact same parts are difficult to find locally. 
You could extend the website with other parts, like you did with the z-axis?

Hi Edou,

Eventually we plan to offer some parts as spares through our website, but at the moment we don't have the inventory to do so. Sorry!
