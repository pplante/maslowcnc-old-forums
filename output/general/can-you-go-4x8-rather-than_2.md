## Can you go 4x8 rather than 8x4?

I'd like to make use of the vertical space in my shop.  Can you change the orientation of the machine so that it is significantly taller than it is wide?

While the chains will reach and the software allows these parameters to be set, I wonder whether the accuracy will suffer when the sled is at the bottom corner of that work area. I feel that the weight of the bricks, the angle of the work surface and friction would be more important in this configuration. It would be interesting to try, though.

You are not the first person to ask about this, you may want to make the arms a little longer or you may suffer accuracy in the bottom corners.

unfortunately, nobody has reported on doing this, so we don't know the results for sure.

davidlang has posted a useful [python program](http://lang.hm/maslow/v-plotter.py) that might help you predict the result.

Extending the arms out longer shouldn’t be a problem.  I’m mostly interested in conserving wall space though.  Also, I’m thinking about mounting the top part the frame with a piano hinge to the wall and then pulling the base up out of the way via some rope and pulley to have it swing up towards the ceiling when it’s not in use.

There are a couple people who have hinged the machine to save space (one to a wall, one to a ceiling)

they built a slightly different frame design, they built a rectangular frame (think of how a wall is framed) instead of depending on the plywood to be stiff enough

I can't think of any reason it wouldn't work, and it might even work better if you get the arm lengths right. I would say if you are willing to enter uncharted waters, go for it and let us know how it works!

I'm in the reservation line.  Hopefully I can let you know how it goes in the Fall :)

If you are going to fold up anyways then doesnt really matter

For the fold up, I've got lights on the ceiling, 4' wide works better for my situation.

Another question about the impercise edge problem.  Is the problem related to the center of gravity vs the router but not maintaining linear "top to bottomness" as the sled moves beneath the motor?  If so, a possible easy solution would be to hang the weight off the sled via a string or roller skate wheel or something making the weight on a "trailer sled".  This should maintain "top to bottomness" regardless of the position.  I assume getting the router as close to center of gravity is always a good thing.

no, the problem is that as the angle of the chains get closer to vertical the amount of sideways force that gravity will provide is lower, so the tension on the other chain is lower and this leads to inaccuracy

I ran through the Python program....If i'm measuring the square inches and feet correctly it looks like there is almost no loss on a 4x8, with the exception of the bottom couple of inches on each end.

Has anyone made a full sheet of 1x1 or 2x2 holes and measured for accuracy?  Are there pics of the inaccuracy in practice?

there was one check of accuracy recently, and the results weren't that good, we are hoping to have other people do the tests as well.
