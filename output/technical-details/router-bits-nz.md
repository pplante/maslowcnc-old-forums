## Router Bits NZ
Posted on **2017-05-26 17:07:13** by **iammartinhill**:

Just a question for any of the Maslow users here in New Zealand; where are you getting your 1/4 in. (~6mm) Up Spiral Router Bits? I'm having a hard time finding what I need for a good price.

We're working on bulk ordering some so that we can offer them at a pretty low price, and we'll ship to NZ as cheaply as we can. That doesn't help you a lot right now, but at least know that you are not alone

I cant say for NZ but I found a bunch on ebay that will ship here to AU with a total cost under $15AUD. obviously there are more expensive ones available there also.
