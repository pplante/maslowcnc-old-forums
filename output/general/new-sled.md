[Sled](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s2/:maslowcnc:aWUC:sled.jpg.jpg) 

18"x24"x1/2" acrylic.  I intend to soften the bottom edges a bit, and expect it will be fogged badly in short order, but.....I can see my stuff!

Thanks guys.  No Carlos, no projects yet.  I'm still working on accuracy and today was new sled making.  I cut some test parts, but I need to do some more tweaking and testing before cutting good material.

Combine it with those HDPE furniture pads to lift it up a bit, and maybe that'll help the scratching.

Just thinking out loud, but I've cut up some cheap WalMart HDPE cutting boards and used them as wear parts on old farm machinery.  They might make decent glides.

That was a great idea!  See the work space!  Round the corners ?
