@prasantapatro Welcome, to answer that, a little more details would be nice. On which operating system are you planing to install it? Windows, Mac OS, Linux?

Hello @prasantapatro, and welcome. A good place to find information is [here](http://www.maslowcnc.com/assemblyguide/). It has links to instructions for the different tasks of getting started.
The software on the computer is called [GroundControl](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/wiki/How-to-Install-Ground-Control), and that page has links to the installation instructions for all operating systems. This is the  [Windows](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/wiki/Windows) link.

@Hannah, @Bar, maybe a 'Start Here' link toward the top of the home page would help folks get started. There is much documentation, and it is coming together continuously, but finding the start of the trail is a challenge :).
