## Buying a new router to go with my Maslow - Brand / Model #?
Posted on **2017-05-15 13:35:32** by **fly-fast**:

I'm on the next round of Maslow's and want to buy my router now.  Can anyone tell me what the recommended brand / model number is for the Maslow?

Greetings! You can find a list of routers that our beta testers are using here: https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Tested-Routers-List



Bar is using the Ridgid R2200 for his development work and there's an AEG-branded version available in the UK.



I expect that list to grow as other Beta testers weigh in with their hardware and other users as well, as the other backers try theirs on.

I hope to see more beta testers weighing in with their hardware. :)

THE RIGID is pretty popular I would just stick with that, but some bits off aliexpress to practice with 1/4" double flute upspiral is most common.

solid carbide is most durable.

What about customers in UK/Europe? The Rigid is not available here, I wonder what people recommend and what z-axis bit to go with it

see  the link above for the aeg equivalent of the rigid, there are also a couple threads already on EU routers
