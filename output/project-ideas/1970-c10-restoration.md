I have "free" access to full sheets of .080 .040 aluminum sheets I am hoping to do some tricky engine bay and dash work.

Sounds interesting.  I have a 1968 Chevy pickup which should be the exact same body style as yours :)

Right, when I was at SEMA a lot of the cars had really creative metal work in the engine bay. The aluminum sheets are already anodized or painted so I am thinking I might go for an aircraft material look. Mine is a 1970 C/K 10 4x4 short bed and I have a really pretty ls3 to put in it.

That looks absolutely gorgeous! Great work.



Testing aluminum has been on my to-do list for a while, but other things seem to always take precedence. Got any tips?



Thanks for sharing! It's so cool to see the machine getting used in ways I never imagined

The whole reason I did not like the middle so I refined the design.

sorry the whole reason for having a home CNC to fix stuff easy and fast

Yeah, I like it even better now too. It looks cleaner.  Would you be OK with us putting your pictures in the weekly update? 



I'm going to try to test aluminum for the update too.

1/16 aluminum all the time in one pass with a palm router set to highest speed, I've cut .080 too, but it requires a bit of force. I use a 1/8" upcut bit
