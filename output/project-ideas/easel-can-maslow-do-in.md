## Easel ?  ( Can Maslow do Inlays )
Posted on **2017-05-28 10:28:21** by **stephboeker**:

Pardon me as I am new to CNC research.  I've been learning about different software's for desktop machines before actually purchasing my first CNC Router.  



a.)   I was very pleasantly surprised to stumble onto this product and want to know if it will run on the software called Easel ( by Inventables) ?

I've been interested in creating "inlays" out of contrasting woods and I understand that Easel works w/ many different products.  It is free and includes and easy to use inlay program.  

b.)   While watching the YouTube video I wondered if you could clamp smaller surface area pieces onto the 4'x8' background ?   If so, I thought it possible to make contrasting wood color types like puzzle pieces that could then be connected.  Also, it might be possible to create a pocket in one piece as well as an insert out of a contrasting colored wood second piece.



Thanks for your generous consideration,

easel will output g-code to run the machine, and the maslow should be able to run it (we haven't had anyone report that they tried, so there may be some bugs to nail down when someone first tries it)



That said, inlay work is extremely sensitive to small errors, and it may be that the maslow is not accurate enough for good result. We won't know until someone tries it. I would probably not buy a maslow if all my work was going to be inlays :-)



yes, you can fasten smaller pieces and work on them, you will probably want to put other wood that's the same thickness as your workpiece around it so that the sled has good support at all times (and watch out that you don't try to cut an inlay area large enough for the sled to fall into it)

if inlays are your thing, a small desktop cnc with gantry rails is the way to go.  99% of inlay work will be much smaller then a 4x8 sheet http://www.gryphoncnc.com/shop/gryphon-v-1-18inch/

Thank you David Lang and Khandam as well for your timely reply's. :)   



First, David, ........ , learning from the video I watched that the machine can get w/ in 1/64" in the central area and then w/ in 1/16" the farther out you geaux, I thought that w/ the Easel "tolerance" options (tight fitting or loose fitting choices), the Maslow just might work :)    



Next, Khandam, ........ , I agree, and previously assumed it obvious that a smaller, sturdier product would absolutely be more accurate.  That said, I am interested in many kinds of work including larger signs and even parts for furniture, etc ... , so, the size of the Maslow does appeal to me.  



I had no idea what to expect in the way of answers, here, but it may turn out to be worth the savings Maslow cam garner, for the option of larger projects, if the smaller ones turn out to be tolerable ! :)   The X-Carve and/or Shapeoko XXL are priced in a range that demands I evaluate every other possibility availab le. :)



Again, thanks for the generous and considerate effort in helping me understand and guidance ! :)

right now the machine is getting around +-1/16, the target is to get it to +- 1/64. we aren't at 1/64 yet (not anywhere)

I was day dreaming today about this very project. I noticed that you skipped the dowel holes and the block to connect the top to the legs?
