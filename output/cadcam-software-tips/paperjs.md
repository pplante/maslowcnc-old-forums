## Paper.js

Found this tool for creating SVG files via JavaScript (http://paperjs.org/). It does way more than creating SVG's, but could be a useful tool, and can be downloaded and used offline.

Found it from this [fractal headboard](http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-CNC-Fractal-Headboard/?ALLSTEPS) build, which is quite neat.

Paperjs seems really cool. It seems like it has a lot of potential for creating cool things at the intersection of art and engineering like that fractal headboard

Don't you find instructables the best thing ever... just to keep your mind continually amazed at things you may never have dreamed of...I love it!! It's worth noting that it is an Autodesk sponsored site although I haven't seen them interfering with other software recommendations. I also look at Make: which is especially good for doable electronic projects and the Adobe site that someone mentioned yesterday, Behance. It shows portfolios of seriously seriously creative Adobe software users. Amazing!! All 3 set my brain running off in different directions, the notebook next to my bed is full again, I won't live long enough to attack all of my ideas. Anyways jbnimble, I was just saying I like instructables too! Michael
