## GitHub question
Posted on **2017-04-18 09:50:49** by **gero**:

Sorry for not having the time to study this, so I'll ask. I have installed GitKraken on my Linux because I assume it is the fastest way to get the latest firmware and GroundControl. Now this Kraken is asking me to Authorize it for GitHub. Can I go ahead? The last thing I want to do is sabotage all the hard work that you guys are doing there daily, so if there is something I should watch out for, please let me know.

You should be good to go ahead. Thanks for asking! GitHub is set up so whenever you make changes it will only be to your copy of the code, no need to worry about messing anything up, you can't. :-)

You can go ahead. Bar still holds the master key so there is a safety valve between our bumbling and the jewels.

At least you can't accidentally change anything. Like @scottsm said, there is a safety mechanism. If you want to make a change you need to make what's called a pull request. Then the whole community can look at what's new and approve the changes.

You do all this programing and still have time for answering. And so fast. AMAZING! Thanks. My programing times are long past and the languages died out. Now it is copy, past and adjust (arduino)
