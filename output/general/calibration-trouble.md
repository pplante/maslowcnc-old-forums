## Calibration trouble
Posted on *2017-06-23 06:30:45* by *Jennifer D*

Morning all,
Trying to get things calibrated this morning and I'm having issues. I'm uncertain if they're software issues or something specific to what I'm doing. I started calibration yesterday, got all the way up to z-axis before I had to leave the shop. I left everything connected but when I returned to finish things this morning the connection had been lost. So I exited and got things talking to each other again. 

Now I'm stuck in the cut calibration step. I ran through the test cut program at least half a dozen times without the measurements getting closer together - below are the measurements for the last three runs:
23.9375" x 24.5" 
24.1875" x 24.75"
24.25" x 23.5"

However, what I'm a more concerned about is that it seems when returning to center it's off.  Attached are pictures of my measurement marks(my plywood has the sled cutout in the center so instead of cutting I've been measuring the distance traveled by the left and top edges of the sled. 

From the main GC screen the machine will return to center and it's accurate, but it's not doing that accurately d uring the calibration program. 

So, first question - is it possible that I somehow lost the measurements previously set during the calibration? 

I'm going to try to run through calibration start to finish again. Hoping it works.

Just ran through calibration start to finish with a fresh piece of plywood and looks like I'm dialed in. I still don't know if I lost yesterday's calibration data or what, I'm just happy to have it calibrated! now to see if I can get the frame parts cut!
