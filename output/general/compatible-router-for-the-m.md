## Compatible Router for the Maslow
Posted on *2017-06-22 14:46:37* by *fkersh*

I am looking to get a new router that is compatible with the Maslow, does anyone know if the Bosch 2.25 HP Fixed-Base Electronic Router 1617EVS would work with it or have any other suggestions? I have  looked at the Rigid R22002 but not quite sure on Home Depot brands, thanks in advance :)

I can't say from having used one other than playing with it in the store, but I would expect that router to work quite well

People with _other_ Bosch models haven't quite gotten things working as they would like with the Z-axis set up yet. It seems to be [hardware in combination with software](http://www.maslowcnc.com/forums/#!/general:z-axis-cant-keep-up).

So my advice is if you want a sure bet, go with the Ridgid. If you are willing to tinker and take some risk, go for the Bosch. Just know there are no guarantees with the Bosch yet. Alternatively you could wait and see if someone else gets the Bosch working.

@mcginniwa is not speaking for all Bosch users. Had Z working accurately in April with the GOF 2000 CE. Everything since then might not be related to the use of a Bosch.

Good to know that the GOF 2000 CE is known to work. Maybe an update to https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Tested-Routers-List#bosch-gof-2000-ce is in order.

Yeah, I was speaking about the 1617EVS not being specifically listed in the tested routers known to work. Until you get confirmation for the specific router you are considering, there is a risk. The choice is about how much risk you are willing to live with.

Looking at [this video of the Z-axis being partially installed on the RA1161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0wXuVn0ibc), it seems like the 1617EVS might be similar and a good bet. Maybe worth reaching out to @jbarchuk to see how it's been working out for him.

If you're worried about the reliability of the Ridgid I wouldn't worry too much.  I've been buying Ridgid tools for probably 15 years.  They are solid and hold up well.   I've steered clear of their cordless stuff as I'm a fan of Milwaukee for that department.

Thanks for all the quick replies, I think that I will invest in the Rigid as it was used in the design unit

Larry357, have you found that router to work with the z-axis?

I dont have it, but from the pics it has a z adjustment that should work. I have a bosch my self, but waiting for the maslow to be shipped.
