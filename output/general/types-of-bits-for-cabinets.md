## Types of bits for cabinets
Posted on **2016-12-21 11:05:16** by **benbayly**:

I'm wondering if I would be able to make cabinets. Specifically looking to cut the parts out, which I can see it has no problem but if I could then switch bits and add some routing details?

remember that this requires that the panels be flat and have a good bit of support around them. If you avoid completely detaching the panels (either by leaving tabs or by not quite cutting all the way through), then you could change bits and come back and work on one side of all your panels.

This would be great for doing things like cutting mounting holes for hinges/shelving/etc

but you aren't going to be able to do bead details or other fancy stuff like that.

And while you could champher/round one edge, you really aren't going to be able to do the other side.

Everything David says is spot on. The only thing I would add is that the way tool changes work is that when the tool change is reached, the machine will power itself down, and tell you which tool to insert next.

I would also consider doing the engraving first, and then switching to cutting. That way you don't have to worry about keeping your parts in place.
