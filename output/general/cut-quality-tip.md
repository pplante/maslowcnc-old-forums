## Cut quality tip

I'm thinking it might be best to use a spiral down-cutting mill in general. This should give the best finish on the cut-edges with minimal tearout. 

Otherwise, for through-cuts, you could mirror your design and then cut from the back side of the workpiece with an up-cutting bit to hopefully get nearly as good of a result, but not sure.
