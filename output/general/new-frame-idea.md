## New Frame Idea
Posted on **2017-04-09 09:12:52** by **rexklein**:

Now that I have been working at this for a bit. I am going to re-do my temp frame. The best part about a beta tester is mapping out (discovering) the best process for the ultimate consumers who will expect a fully ready to go Maslow with little trouble.

I am keeping the $500 target in mind. I have a new plan in my head for it and will send pics when I am done.

is there a dimension diagram of a complete maslow available somewhere?

---

Posted on **2017-04-09 14:33:50** by **jbarchuk**:

Sketchup can report dimensions in *.skp drawings. As far as the displaying dimensions directly, no, there is no proper 'formal' drawing.

---

Posted on **2017-04-09 14:35:22** by **rexklein**:

I could think of a couple of could reasons to have that @Bar

You may already be aware of the sketchup file in the CommunityGarden repository, but just in case:



https://github.com/MaslowCNC/CommunityGarden/blob/master/Deluxe%20Stand.skp



I cloned the repo to get a useable version of the file.

---

Posted on **2017-04-09 14:56:42** by **Bar**:

I can absolutely make a dimensions drawing. Whenever you want something like that done, just make an issue for it GitHub and it will be on my list. If you are looking for it, then others are too.

can't test till my new chain gets here, I tried but the bent links got me should have new chain on Tuesday.

---

Posted on **2017-04-09 22:20:02** by **scottsm**:

Were the saw cuts for the plywood 'ears'? Are those 4x4s holding the plywood ends? I like it, it looks very stout!

---

Posted on **2017-04-09 22:46:12** by **scottsm**:

Something I notice that gave me grief - the cup hook on the upper bar will interfere with the chain when cutting on the near edge of the sheet. I moved mine outboard, and reversed the threading of the tensioner sprocket to put the tail outboard.



 Another thing that bit me was the z-axis cable hanging like that. Mine came partly undone and the z-drive went rogue. The fix is easy, I used a Velcro cable strap around the z-drive motor to hold the cable in place.



 The more I look at it the better I like it. It's a bit more lumber but looks much sturdier. I might look for something thinner for the bottom rail, though, so the sled can reach nearer the edge of the sheet. I wonder if the geometry of the lower tensioning points will need some re-thinking if I do that...

---

Posted on **2017-04-10 08:31:09** by **rexklein**:

Yes the cuts were for the plywood ears. Thanks for the cup hook and z-axis info I will do that right away it coming loose is inevitable I had not thought about securing the cable like that.

Yes They are 4X4" I used them for 4 reasons.

1. My location made it make sense to make a leaning frame (adjustable)

2. Just plain Beef

3. 4 ears, using the 4x4 gave me a lot of area to attach them  

4. They tended to be more uniform that the 2x4's



I had that thought as well about the bottom. Still noodling on what to do.

---

Posted on **2017-04-10 09:20:04** by **Bar**:

That looks great! It seems like you built a lot of flexibility into the design around the positioning of the motors and the tilt of the frame which is exciting.

---

Posted on **2017-04-10 09:58:11** by **rexklein**:

Yes I wanted to have room to adjust. Also there is an enormous amount of self doubt in building the temp frame I was overwhelmed motors go here wires go there measure this etc there is so much thrown at a newbie Maslow user. I decided to build something with little effort that would set myself up learning Maslow I don't like fighting with the design right out of the box. If I find a perfect tilt then I will just cut frame supports with the Maslow. Anyone could build that Frame in 2 hours maximum. Most maslow users probably 30 minutes

Its just a little ovalized. But as a first run for a new maslow thats not bad at all.

Awesome!

Posted on **2017-04-12 08:02:32** by **Bar**:

What a fantastic first run.

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 15:09:38** by **rollandelliott**:

I like this frame the best, I can pretty must look at it and build something similar but a cut list for those who want to repeat it exactly would be nice. The Maslow self cutting bunny ears dont' seem nearly as userfriendly to make.

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 15:48:29** by **jbarchuk**:

There really is no cut list as such, because as described there are -only- two cuts. :)

The 2x4 and 4x4 are full length 6' and 10'.

The plywood sheet is a full 4x8.

Given those facts, the gap on the left and right sides of the plywood sheet are 12".

There's a gap at the bottom that appears to be about 8" to the top of the horizontal stud nearest the bottom.

The plywood pieces in the corners aren't even 'very required' because the motors are mounted on the horizontal stud. However they do add a bunch of strength and stability in the corners. Those pieces, just measure to fill the remaining space from wherever the big plywood frame piece up to the top corners of the stud frame pieces.

The two cuts would be to make those corner pieces, cut off the end of a sheet of plywood (one cut) and then split that piece in half (second cut.)

But that doesn't quite make sense for the two cut thing. If there's a gap at the bottom, then the space at the top can't be 24". It's in the range of 16" or 18". That means that the piece cut off the end of a 4x8 can't be simply cut in half, there  needs to be another cut. So I -think- it's 3 cuts but open to correction.

However if those pieces of plywood in the corners were left off, it'd be a true 'no cuts' frame, just screw together all the full length studs! :)

It's a -very- clever frame, very minimal work to build.

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 15:58:46** by **Bar**:

That is pretty brilliant that it all comes cut to length. Maybe we should just recommend that everyone do it this way? My only concern is that on the ears version the motors are moved forward so that the chains are kept in plane the sheet of plywood being cut. The ideal situation is that the motors are moved forward the same distance as where the chain is anchored on the sled. The chains will feed a lot more evenly that way. Is there any way we could move them forward?

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 16:57:19** by **rollandelliott**:

not sure how much the motors need to be moved forward, but seems pretty easy to accomplish with a shim or board of some sort.

 definitely think this design is easier than the original to make!

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 17:15:38** by **jbarchuk**:

The chain connection at the sled can be moved down a couple of notches, and that will 'parallelise' the chains to the working surface. That's less work and no new parts. 'Parallelify?' Not sure, I'm a tech guy not a language geek.

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 17:55:48** by **rexklein**:

Let me clarify (I am awed that you guys are even talking about my frame.)

1. It is 8x10 

2. I chose 8' because it's enough and most people have at least that much space. 

3. you need the 12" gap at the bottom for many reasons power, vacuum and most of all for easier  loading of material 

4. The 4x4 worked great for rigidity but also they gave me a better surface connection area and allow for future mods. 

5. The ears are a must the motor mounts are slotted and just calibrating they were moving. The ears solve it completely I just aligned the chain to the correct sled holes. 3rd one up (for mine).

6. I am not sure that the height of the motors is the best but as you can see that is easily changed .

7. Tilt I think that the tilt is gonna vary based on the sled and job and a whole host of other reasons. 



I had a lot of plywood from the second sheet left to make a @Bar approved sled. My take away is this might not be "the approved model" but as a newbie I would be ge tting what I thought I signed up for which is a machine that cuts a circle (pretty close anyway) on my first run.

I dub thee the "Rex Frame"

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 18:08:35** by **rexklein**:

Oh and by the way for a truly no cut frame don't they sell precut 24x24 pieces of plywood at home depot and lowes etc. I like the concept of zero waste of material. I almost want to build it over again to see if I can do it with literally no cuts and no waste. Which is in keeping with maslow ecological philosophy (I can't believe I am making an eco argument to @Bar of all people)

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 18:41:32** by **Bar**:

Hahha I do love me some simple (no cuts), ecological (no waste) design. 



Very well done!



Do you have any issues with the chains feeding cleanly when you are up at the top left or right corners of the 4x8? I chose the third whole in from the top (one up from yours) for balance, but one hole of movement isn't a big issue. If not, then the motor distance isn't an issue. If it's not a problem, then it's not a problem!



I feel like since we promised "two sheets of plywood, three 2x4s, and two bricks" in the kickstarter video I've got an obligation to spec a frame with those materials...but I also want to make it clear to people following the directions that there are other...quite possibly better alternatives if they are willing to pick up a few extra boards. Especially since while you've got to buy a couple extra 2x4s, you get almost a full sheet of plywood to play with which is probably a net cost savings.



What's the best way we can edit the instructions to make the fact that there are some great alternatives to the main plan clear?

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 20:11:01** by **jbarchuk**:

Those 2'x2' sheets of plywood are a SPECTACULAR waste of $ EXCEPT for someone who needs only one or two small pieces and will NEVER (ever) use the rest of a full sheet. At Lowes a 4x8 sheet of 3/4" birch of $50. With a little loss due to cut widths a 4x8 can yield 8 2x2s. A 2x2 costs $14. 8 x 14 = $112 or MORE THAN TWICE the cost of the single sheet.

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 20:13:48** by **rexklein**:

True but I was being altruistic. I think every builder can use and has a skill saw. How is it fun if you don't get ripped off by lowes?

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 20:14:50** by **rexklein**:

It's simple, I have been in business a long time. And this is a situation where we wait and see. I am just learning the software now. If my frame works well (not proven yet) then its very simple. I will diagram my frame and list materials you then list it as a proven alternate, skill level low material cost increase X. You just state here is the std. design here are beta testers proven designs. let the maker choose. I can tell you the major flaw in the original is the wings if I can barely cut a circle how can I ever cut those wings as a newbie

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 20:16:53** by **rexklein**:

@jbarchuk I am still laughing I was thinking of the spectaular ripoff those are. I was drinking @bars coolade

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 22:11:24** by **davidlang**:

the chain attachments to the sled have to deal with two things



1. the balance on the sled (if you attach the chains too close to the work surface, the router may want to tip out, especially if the frame is close to vertical)



2. keeping the chains close to parallel to the work surface so that when you get to the upper corners, the chain does not try to come off the sprockets

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 22:15:31** by **davidlang**:

@bar, you have a design that uses exactly the specified wood, but this is so much simpler to build that I would suggest seriously considering switching to this as the default design and just have a footnote that points to the old design if someone needs it.

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 22:17:22** by **davidlang**:

by the way, this design will need a couple more 2x4s to make legs for it, and we need to work out the best angle for it, but those are simple modifications (just figure out what angle works best and then find dimensions that are easy to measure/cut rather than ones that make the perfect angle :-)

Doesn't matter all that much what tools the user has because the Big Box of Wood can cut anything the customer needs. Part of the intent of Maslow is that the temp frame can build the parts for the real frame. Personally I think that's much extra work for not much gain. But again that's for the folks that don't have much and shouldn't need to get much more to build the machine.

The temp frame this -is- a good idea. So far results have been less than optimal but if calibration can be made more accurate then it could be -excellent- for the 'few tools' user.

A poll for this might be a good idea... I think there are a LOT of ppl who are short on the woodworking skills and tools required but have lots of great ideas. If Maslow can produce an Ikea-kit style stack of wood that all they have to do is screw the pieces together, then that wins about 80% of the battle for them.

A couple more studs is trivial. People are spending upwards of $700 to build this thing. Another $6 or $12 is extremely trivial compared to the TIME they're going to invest never mind the $. Not a deal break er.

I should have said that leaving the plywood ears of was only to make it a hypothetical no-cuts frame, but it's definitely not a good idea. The vertical and horizontal frame studs above the big plywood sheet, that area has much less lateral strength. The plywood ears make it rock solid.

That's what the Mechanicals wiki is for. Meaning that's where different designs should reside, and the instructions page can point there. As I said, the $ difference of a couple of sticks of wood is trivial. The user knows what their skills level is. They can decide whether they like one design or another from a TLAR point of view, read about pluses and minuses of each, and decide if they have the skills to build it.

---

Posted on **2017-04-12 23:27:48** by **rexklein**:

@jbarchuk you hit it on the head exactly as innovative and interesting as the Maslow building itself is, the user still has to understand software firmware etc. Us beta testers are supremely interested and willing participants but the regular backers they won't be so kind. I like the idea of having a list of images and plans from those who care enough to provide them to @Bar. You had the same thought as me lot of work for temp frame when I can build it quickly and get on with using it.



BTW @Bar when you do release try to get feedback on what frame people gravitate to it will be fascinating to see the difference between Beta Testers and Regular Backers.

just tried to add this alternative frame to the wiki, but I guess my new GitHub account is flagged. maybe someone else can add it.

---

Posted on **2017-04-13 06:28:42** by **rollandelliott**:

my GitHub account is fixed and I made a new wiki page for anyone with alternative frame designs here:

https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Alternative-Frame-desing-from-Beta-Testers

also made a link from the main original self assembly instructions.

---

Posted on **2017-04-13 06:47:27** by **davidlang**:

why did you decide to go with 4x4 instead of just 2x4s? I would think that once they are attached to the backer board it would be ridged enough.

Posted on **2017-04-13 08:59:32** by **davidlang**:

as a note, you could probably go with 6' for the verticals instead of 8' and then use a 2x6 or 2x8 as the top plate (on edge and moving the motors out a bit from the frame)

---

Posted on **2017-04-13 09:00:48** by **davidlang**:

As this is a setup that doesn't have a fixed angle to it, I'll be interested to see how you find it works cutting at different tilt angles)

Posted on **2017-04-13 09:26:17** by **rexklein**:

Sorry I didn't answer your question. I decided on 4x4 to give me options. For example what if the tilt starts to affect the chain mechanism I might at a further date what to fill that hole in so the chain can't dip so far the stretchy string does not have that much tension.
