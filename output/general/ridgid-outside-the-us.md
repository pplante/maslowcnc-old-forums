## Ridgid outside the U.S.
Posted on **2017-02-03 13:10:43** by **gilles_tribricks**:

Hi there,
I'm starting to look for a Ridgid R2200 here in Europe but I'm having a hard time finding any... Does anyone know if it's sold under another brand name ? From the kickstarter presentation it looks like the one I should get.
I did find the reconditioned ones on ebay (shipping internationally) but they run on 110V.

Thanks !
Gilles

Ridgid is a subsidary of Emerson Electric, which is an American brand with limited penetration in Europe. As best I can tell, the only Ridgid tools sold in Europe are the Time Saver line of plumbing/mechanical tools. Ridgid tools, however are manufactured by TTI in Hong Kong but only for Home Depot.

Basically, finding a Ridgid router outside the U.S. is going to be tough. I can't say for certain where the tools are and aren't sold,

TTI also produces AEG tools, however, and as I understand it, AEG is a fairly common brand in the UK.

In fact, the spindle of the AEG MF 1400 KE is strikingly similar to the Ridgid R2200. Whether or not the plunge base resembles the Ridgid one, I can't say.

Good deduction! I'd go out on a pretty stable limb and say that the spindle is identical. It looks like there is a fixed base version that is nearly the same except for the handles.  [AEG](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:ENR0:aeg.jpg.jpg)

Nice! I wonder if AEG is as prevalent in NZ? Those guys seem to have a tough time finding routers.

Thanks a lot for your replies. Yes, AEG has a widespread distribution network here in Europe so I may go for them rather than buying a ridgid router plus a 220V-110V converter.
They offer two models. I wonder which one is the closest to the R2200.

https://www.aeg-powertools.eu/en-gb/products/woodworking/routers/of-2050-e
The first one is a "combo" router but I don't understand which second feature it combines with a router.
 Thanks a lot for the great tip !

probably the first is closest, but we would need more pictures of them to know.

neither of them shows the depth adjustment

'combo' router probably means that it includes two bases, a 'fixed' base and a 'plunge' base, the r2200 is a 'fixed' base router.

Guys,

I found the manual for the MF-1400-KE;

that link isn't working for me (DNS failure)

---

Posted on **2017-02-05 12:55:13** by **davidlang**:

ok, it worked on the second try, that one looks good. the base without the two large posts is the one you would want to use. If you can get a version of it without the other base (the 'fixed' base is what you want, the 'plunge' base is not), you would save some money

AEG has distribution for some tools in NZ, but I have yet to come across a router. I'll see if taking that part number to local dealer rings any bells.

400€ + :(

Posted on **2017-02-07 02:33:29** by **mazeltov**:

Also looking for a R2200 alternative. I got a mate that can buy it for me in the states but meh @ voltage converter, possible customs & possible delays when shipping. Plus the shipping will be expensive for a 90$ router :s
I been looking at most of the routers that are available here in EU. The ones i like all have problematic Z axis systems that will make it a pain to add the zaxis motor. the ones that could work are all 400€+
I don't get that pricetag on the AEG one. It would be perfect and i guess it comes from the same assemblyline then the Rigid but i won't spend 4x the price just for a rebranded router -_-

well, instead of going for a super-expensive router, you can look at going with a CNC spindle like some of these

There are lots of plans out there for building a router lift out of wood that could be adapted to provide a Z axis for any of these.

Remember that unlike most CNC designs, we aren't trying to minimize the weight here, we add weight with bricks, so if you build something heavy for the Z acis, you can just reduce the weight of bricks.

Posted on **2017-02-07 03:57:53** by **davidlang**:

they also have routers (although none with a good Z axis)

this could be removed from the base and mounted in a homebrewed lift

This one has a nut that turns instead of a shaft, not nearly as good as the r2200

Spindles could be an option but i'm planning to use the router also for other projects so without the Maslow. Plus i really want dustcollection and all that jazz. I feel i'll go for an R2200 with converter in the end. Other options all seem not ideal for a hasslefree experience ;]

Had clicked the link for the router Bar placed on the campaign page ( under, "What is not included in the box?")  I must say that I am concern, because even though I was happy to buy it with overseas shipping.  Ridgid official site made buying soooooooo painful.  Most of the featured online retailers they listed did not feature it at all (tried 5 already).  Retiring for the nite!

Amazon did have a listing of it but is appears from the pic of the zipped Pack and the description, that the vacuum attachment seemed to be missing.

Searched this complete island for days to find a router that would work with the Z-Axis. I found a Bosch GOF 2000 CE Professional and short circuited on purchase. Unpacking at home to measure the shaft, I found it quite heavy. It must be around 6 kg. Together with the bricks I am worried if that is to much for the motors. What does the Ridgid R2200 weigh?
Anyone interested in details of that thing, I am happy to assist. [Bosh-GOF200CEPro](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:M9hd:boshgof200cepro.jpg.jpg)

Would this work? https://www.iedepot.ie/gmc-plunge-trimmer-router-quarter-inch/
Why are folks going for such big routers? 2hp and 1/2" is surely overkill.

Posted on **2017-02-08 11:04:55** by **jamesbil**:

Just noticed the aeg is an 8mm collet. Still a big beast tho. I was hoping the Bosch GFK600 or the Makita RTO700CX2 would work. But it looks like not. There is a 1/4" Triton that looks like it might work, I have its big brother.

Posted on **2017-02-08 12:05:03** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

Cutting tools come in a lot of different sizes and the diameter is configured in GroundControl to ensure your offset is correct. I guess what I'm saying is that you needn't limit your router choice to collet size.

---

Posted on **2017-02-08 20:28:06** by **davidlang**:

@jamesbil

That one doesn't look like it gives you a depth adjustment. It has an adjustable depth stop, but if you turn that it won't drive the router down into the wood.

I agree that 2HP and 1/2" is overkill for the cutting that has been shows, how much overkill is still up in the air. After last week's video, we saw that the machine could be driver much faster (with much deeper cuts) than they have been doing so. Bar was nervous, about how long the bit would last, but he showed that the 2HP router didn't run out of power when cutting all the way through 3/4" plywood in a single pass (with a 1/4" bit)
