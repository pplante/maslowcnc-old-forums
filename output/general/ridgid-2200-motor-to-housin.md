## RIDGID 2200 motor to housing slop

Was curious about the z axis, what keeps the motor from bouncing around inside the housing if the motor is actuating the depth and you aren't there to lock the locking feature each time depth is adjusted?

Great question. There is a locking feature which is a clasp on the bottom of the router. There is a nut which sets the tension that the clasp applies. By rotating that nut you can adjust the fit between the router and the base until the fit is tight enough to prevent wobble, but loose enough to allow the mechanism to move. 

It was recommended elsewhere in the forums today that coating the router with a lubricating wax can help prevent corrosion and at the same time reduce friction.
