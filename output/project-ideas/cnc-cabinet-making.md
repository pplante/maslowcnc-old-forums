Do you think Maslow can do full job kitchen cabinets?

I think if you are talking about building cabinets for yourself it's a great idea and would work well. I know a lot of cabinet shops are going to CNC these days. As a job machine to run a cabinet shop, I think you would probably be better off with a machine like a ShopBot that's really built to work in a production environment.

the ability of a machine like the maslow or shopbot to work on a full sheet of plywood to cut out all the panels, and to drill all the holes (including the blind holes for shelf mounts) is a wonderful thing.

If you are going to do this, could you create plans and distribute them (and the resulting g-code)?

I agree that for a production shop, a shopbot is going to be much faster, and therefor better for the shop,  than the maslow. But for someone doing their own house, buying a maslow for the sole purpose of building their cabinets would probably be a significant win.

Yeah I plan doing plans myself, so I wouldn't mind giving back to the community. However, I think Maslow is great because of its price point. Lets say a complete Maslow costs 750 dollars and one 4x8 Shopbot is 18,995 dollars. I could literally buy 25 Maslow set ups. I think pound for pound, Maslow is amazing because it is so scalable.

It's too bad they dont share the DXF files. They have some really cool stuff!
