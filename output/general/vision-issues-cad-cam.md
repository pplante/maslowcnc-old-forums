## Vision Issues / CAD / CAM

Hi everyone,

Just wanted to reach out to the group in a request for some help.

I have a degenerative eye disease (retinitis pigmentose) that makes it hard for me to see low contrast text on the computer screen.  The black background of Ground Control makes it easy for me to see.  I have my Windows 10 set up the same way (white text on black background to help with this issue, as well.

The issue I'm having is with Fusion 360.  I have a degree in CAD (got it back in 2003), and I'm familiar with Inventor, but I can't see the lightly colored text on the white background of Fusion 360.

Is there a way to change this appearance to match what I'm used to in AutoCAD?  If  not, does anyone out there that's familiar with computers know of a way to quickly switch between standard and reverse colors like I can do on my phone?

If not, anyone know of a good CAD/CAM software package that has high-contrast interface?

Any help is greatly appreciated!

I bought Maslow with the idea supplementing my disability income once I go blind by designing and cutting things to sell at a flea ma rket (build-it yourself kits that people can take home, paint/stain, and enjoy assembling with their kids (hopefully easier and more fun than IKEA products).  To achieve this, I need to be able to design a few ideas I have.  A few ideas for projects would be the coat racks, rocking horses, wooden game boards, small toys, etc.
