## Any router in St Louis area?

I would love to see one of these in action before I purchase one, although with the inexpensive price I might end up buying one anyway.  If there is anyone that will be getting one in the February shipment I would love to see it in action.  I am an engineer (Festus area) and moderately skilled wood worker and would be willing to offer assistance if desired also.



Thank you.



Bill

That's probably why he said "...If there is anyone that will be getting one in the February shipment I would love to see it in action."

Bill I live in St. Louis and I am on the waiting list. Once the kit arrives you are welcome to come take a look at it. I plan on using it for general hobbies and teaching kids design and fab.

Sincerely,

Chris

The vids provided are pretty good. If there are details you'd like to see more of then ask and maybe they can provide pics or vids. Or Qs about other functionality details.

What they -say- it will do it -will- do. That's their focus right now. Adjustments and improvements will be made, but mostly in the direction of the promised/intended specs.
