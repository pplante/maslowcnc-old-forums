## Another Z-Axis Question
Posted on **2017-06-02 05:55:53** by **ethanwaldman**:

I want to order a Z-axis to ship along with my Maslow, but I don't yet have a router. I'm planning to buy the Rigid R2200 though, and want to make sure I choose the correct Z-axis kit. Would that be the first option listed?
