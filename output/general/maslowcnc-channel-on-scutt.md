## #maslowcnc channel on scuttlebutt.nz
Posted on **2017-04-08 23:54:49** by **mcginniwa**:

Been playing around with scuttlebutt (https://scuttlebutt.nz), a decentralized social network, today. Thought people here might be interested in it. I've started a #maslowcnc channel... if you join ssb.rootsystems.nz, pub.mixmix.io, or pi.bret.io pubs, I think you should be able to find the channel.

Sorry if this is too far off topic.
