Just curious what your projected time frames were for the two tiers. Will beta be trying the z-axis mod?

Great question. We're looking to get the beta kits sent out three months from the end of the campaign. That might seem like a long time, but we'd rather be early than late ;-). 

We're aiming to have the z-axis mod ready for the beta testers to test.

PS: Go UCSC!

Is there ETA on the standard delivery as of right now? I was thinking of doing that one, but If its 3 months for Beta I might actually be more interested in that, I could be a great ginny pig.
