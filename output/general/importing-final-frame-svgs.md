## Importing final frame svg's into Fusion 360
Posted on **2017-05-28 15:41:48** by **ledsled71**:

When importing a final frame part (in this case, the motor mount), it imports into Fusion 360 with a width of 1.5mm (the side opposite the holes).  Obviously, this isn't the correct scale.  How do I know what scale to make it?

the parts are probably in inches instead of mm. 1.5 inches is very reasonable.

I tried changing the units, and it imports as .075in

If you are just going to create a Gcode for it, put it into Makercam.com.  It will import correct scale and easy to set up a path to cut.  Then open the gcode directly in Ground Control and cut away!

I think I remembered Fusion360 being willing to import Sketchup files?
