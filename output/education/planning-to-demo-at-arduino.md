## Planning to demo at Arduino Day

Went by [1st Assembly](http://1-a.co.nz) last night for a meetup and found out they are hosting an [Arduino Day](http://huttstemm.nz/events/arduino-day-at-1st-assembly-free/?date=2017-05-06+00%3A00%3A00) on May 6th. Essentially inviting the public to learn about what is possible and experiment with arduinos.

Thought it would be cool for people to see what can be done with arduinos in practice, so offered to set up my MaslowCNC for some demos.

Now I just have to get off my sorry butt and put it together ;)
