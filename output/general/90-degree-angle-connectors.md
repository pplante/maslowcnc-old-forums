## 90 degree angle connectors
Posted on *2017-04-21 18:33:31* by *nathanmiller*

I'm trying to learn how to join two pieces of plywood/OSB at a 90 degree angle like this: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--n9402OLTus/U_6noVXA59I/AAAAAAAACSc/oZ05jYxALrg/s1600/j118.jpg
 then secure them without special drilling or screwing of brackets but I'm struggling to find something. I think I could use something like this... maybe: http://www.woodpeck.com/crossdowels.html
but there has got to be a better way! 
Home Reserve makes a patented connector and it's cool, but I don't think it's available to the public: http://twoboysonegirlandacrazymom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040511_0010_3.jpg
Any ideas on how to connect two pieces with an off the shelf connector?

For the record, I'm dreaming about an open source furniture system that is totally modular and could be printed with Maslow. The project would include fabric patterns the maker could sew (or have sewn at their local shop). Home Reserve is my inspiration. Here's a family assembling one: http://twoboysonegirlandacrazymom.com/home-reserve-couch-review/

and here is an image of a whole sofa frame: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/39/36/5d/39365db58f2a56a93db36a394fea57bc.jpg

Do you want to do it [with](http://catalogues.titusplus.com/TitusFurnitureHardware_15-16_EN/index.html) or [without](http://makezine.com/projects/make-33/cnc-panel-joinery-2/) hardware?

Over sized square nuts would do the same thing
Personally id nust glue or screw it  really not that hard to do

Have you looked at pocket hole jigs. Kreg makes one that is amazing.
