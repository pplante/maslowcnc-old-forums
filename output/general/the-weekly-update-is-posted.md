Nice work on the stand!

On the topic of the Z axis, you've done a survey to find out what size shaft couplers people would want - did anyone say if they owned this router from Harbor Freight?

http://www.harborfreight.com/1-1-2-half-hp-variable-speed-plunge-router-67119.html

I'm looking at buying one as a "starter" router, but the manual doesn't give technical info of the kind you're asking :) I would very much like to order the Z axis, but want to make sure I get the right bits.

Thanks!

That router is a plunge router which means that the router is free to move up and down, the z-axis is meant to attach to a fixed base router which means that the router is permanently attached to the base. Fixed base routers generally have a thumb knob which lets you set the depth and that is where the z-axis motor would attach. This video might help explain some of the pros and cons of different routers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Kv3GZI6Og&t=2s

I'm sure that some of our members will automate plunge routers like that one from Harbor Freight, but you would need to build some type of add on mechanism to do the actual lowering and raising of the router.

Thanks for the video etc - I feel educated :) I'll see what my options are for fixed-base routers (most of what you showed in the video is here as well).

if you look at the images of that router xlosely, you will see the the depth adjustment is not connected between the router and the base. it's a stop. The router moves freely on the vertical bars and is spring loaded to keep it away from the material. That stop is adjustable (but not something that could be motorized) to limit how deep it can go, but you have to muscle it down into the wood to have it hit that stop

@Bar... "Fixed base routers generally have a thumb knob which lets you set the depth and that is where the z-axis motor would attach. This video..."

There seem to be three basic kinds of fixed based adjusters, one is muuuch more 'automation friendly' than the others.

In order, in my opinion, from most difficult to easiest to automate.

1) The whole router rotates and rises/falls on a screw thread. If a gear were wrapped around the router, and another gear drove that, it could actually have the best depth resolution. It's also be the slowest.

2) The screw adjustment isn't directly physically 'connected' to the router. The router is held up by a spring, and pressed down by the operator, then clamped there to hold the depth in place. The screw adjustment acts a a depth limiter.

This could be automated, but the main problem is that the bottom end of the screw shaft often isn't attached to anything. It hangs free in space, drops when the router is pushed down, and stops the router from descending any further. In that position, the only way to raise or lower the router is  to turn the shaft, and that's what a motor would do. But the entire system is clamped pretty tightly by the spring pushing -up- on the router. There's zero backlash, that's a plus, because it's spring loaded. However the -force- required to turn that shaft is pretty powerful. Remember that the lower end of the screw rod is pressed against a stop, but given that pressure at the -bottom- of the shaft, and then applying a -torsion- to the -top- of the shaft, I'd bet 4-1 odds that the bottom tip of the shaft is gonna walk right off whatever it's pressed against, maybe bend the shaft, maybe break the frame. It's possible to grind the shaft to a point, and drill a tiny indentation in the base, to keep the shaft on center, but that's pretty iffy. Maybe possible to mount a bushing around the bottom of the shaft, that'd be very strong. The point though is that this style router base requires mods where the next style doesn't.

Neither of those two styles are anywhere NEAR as simple as...

3) In your video, the Rigid, Ryobi and Bosch have the 'adjustment connected to router by a tab-slot,' where the screw drives the nut, the nut moves up and down, which is connected to the tab, which is fit into a slot in the router. -Both- ends of the drive shaft are -firmly- mounted to the base assembly, both above and below the nut. -This- system is best for this purpose because it's easiest to automate.

The Bosh though, where you said 'clamp is not adjustable.' That might be a deal breaker, or at least add a bunch of work to do a mod so that it clamps 'properly.' Properly meaning hold the router slip-tight but not too tight and not sloppy/wobbly. The point of the variable depth while the router is in operation means that the clamp can't be tightly closed. Full open is probably (maybe/likely?) too loose to be much accurate. If the clamp isn't adjustable then the tab that operates the clamp might have something added to press it a certain distance and then stop, basically an add-on tightness adjustment.

@jbarchuk

your #2 is what's considered a "plunge" base, not a fixed base.

on fixed base routers there are three styles

1. rotate the entire router

2. vertical screw adjustment

3. horizontal "rack and pinion" adjustment

bar shows all three of these styles in his video, along with other nuances like the ability to tighten or loosen the router so it can be adjusted but still held fairly firmly (they are all designed to be adjusted, and then locked in place for use)

Just watched the video, you guys have an amazing selection of f/b routers! And the prices!! They have yet to take off this side of the Atlantic. @bar would you be so good as to cast your eye over this router for us euro folk?http://www.tritontools.com/en-GB/Product/Power%20Tools/Routers/MOF001

I had no idea they would be so hard to find abroad. :-/

I took a look at that router. It seems well made, but it is a plunge router, not a fixed base router which could make it difficult to use. I would recommend a fixed base router. The difference is that a fixed base router locks the bit at a set depth, while a plunge router is free to move in and out. That isn't necessarily a problem, some plunge routers have a lock which can hold them in place, but I don't have enough experience with that style to tell.

You might want to check out the conversation called "Plunge Router" going on below this one. Some people with more experience with plunge routers than me have made some insightful comments.

Thanks for looking Bar, I realise it's a plunge but it also has quite a unique fine adjustment system that will raise or lower it. Also the option to remove the plunge spring. The 2nd and 4th pic show these parts.
