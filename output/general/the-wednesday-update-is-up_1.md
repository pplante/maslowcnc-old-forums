The Wednesday update is up! Read all about our crazy week here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1830738289/maslow-cnc-a-500-open-source-4-by-8-foot-cnc-machi/posts/1894317

The highlights include pictures from Maker Faire, and this week's software improvements like @scottsm's brilliant use of one of the aux ports to detect the tool length automatically, and @johnwebber's addition of some new useful new buttons to Ground Control.  Improvements to the math let us bump the feedrate limit up to 35ipm.
