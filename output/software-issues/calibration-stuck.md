## Calibration stuck
Posted on **2017-07-17 19:36:03** by **beettlle**:

I'm trying to run the calibration but it's stuck on before for the last vertical cut in "step 8 of 9".  The "Re-cut test pattern" button is still grayed out but it's been over 10 minutes and I haven't gotten any new instruction to finish the square.  I'm running this on a Mac (OS X 10.12.5) with Ground Control 0.80.  

If I stop the cut and start again it gets stuck in the same place.  I've tried it twice now.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Never-mind, I think I know what's going on.  Negative numbers mean into the wood and positive numbers mean out of the wood.  Looks like I've made giant gashes that weren't necessary.  Trying gain.

I did the same thing, also the recut button only enables after entering the numbers. The end result should be a 1 inch vertical line, a 1x1 inch vertical and horizontal L shaped line and finally a 1 inch horizontal line.
