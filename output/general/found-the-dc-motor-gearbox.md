Nice find. Looks like they are used as motors for vending machines

The problem is the minimum order, the manufacturer requires that you order them 1000 at a time.

In this forums topic of "open source parts" it was pointed out this is the geared motor.
Another Forum member contacted the company and they responded.

Contacted ETONM yesterday about the motors. got the response below:

“ I know what you look for. we received many inquiries already.

As there are too many samples orders in our sample department, now we have passed these gear motors samples orders to our customers in America, you can contact them for samples. ”

I have asked a couple times via maslow contact email if I could get the part number and try and source or purchase two. No response. I know they are busy  getting everything organized. We have ours built and works with 100:1 planetary gears minus the drift on power down. The following worm gear is fairly robust and used in our robotics program. http://a.co/c34rjGl Put an order in today and will test this week.

Willishf,
I doubt you will get an answer for the next couple of weeks as they are swamped. They had 108 beta testers out of 1,279 supporters which already have their units. Now they got the other  1,171 Kickstarter supporters (like me) to send out units as well as the ones from the on-line sales (another couple hundred). With only a 3-4 person shop that is trying to get this done in the next few weeks I am sure they are wanting their loyal Kickstarter backers to get their units first before selling individual parts.

Completely understand on being busy and why trying other options. No worries.

Bar has confirmed that this is the part number, the trouble is that the manufacturer doesn't have any US distributer that will sell retail (they point people at Maslow)

After the kickstarter orders are shipped out, there will be a period where he needs to spend a lot of his time on support/debugging, but they will then need to decide when to order another batch of parts for the next set of orders.

Bar has said that they want to be able to sell parts, but they need to figure out what the pricing is going to be (they don't want to make it cheaper for people to order all the parts individually than to buy a kit for example), and they need to make sure that they are charging enough to cover their time in processing orders.

We don't want a repeat of what happened with the makesmith kit where they decided that it wasn't cost effective for them to keep making and selling kits after the kickstarter ended. I suspect that this is going to mean that the price of the kits will go up, but we'll have to see what happens.

Willishf,
I do understand your frustration.
I did find this "all metal gear" motor on Ebay without encoder.

or this one on Ebay with encoder

that last one looks like it's probably a good fit (but it draws much more current than the default ones, take that into account on your motor driver)

So basically they are saying, we do not currently have any motors as we sold all of our motors to maslowcnc so contact them for samples.

 Something tells me they forgot to tell Hannah about this. :)

they seem to be saying (all along) that they don't sell quantities of less than 1000, and (probably) are not in a position to handle the extra hassle such small order requests create.

---

Posted on *2017-06-28 07:15:14* by *davidlang*

exactly what mrfugu is saying. This isn't uncommon in parts suppliers. they want to make the items and ship them out in large quantities and leave it up to someoen else to deal with the hassle of selling to individuals.

They have a program to sell samples to people that may later end up buying them by the thousands, and this works for hobbiests when only a few people want one. But when you have a project like Maslow and a bunch of people want them at once, they quickly notice the large number of requests and cut off the samples to everyone (or at least everyone who's not a big company)

more and more companies are setting up web stores, or selling through one of the big websites (Aliexpress, Amazon, ebay, etc) but this company apparently doesn't

The minimum order is now 2 of the topmost link

---

Posted on *2017-06-29 07:33:42* by *TomTheWhittler*

axel.
The minimum order has always been 2 for the topmost link. If you try to order any amount then Alibaba sends your request to Etonm sales from which Etonm sales replies you now have to contact Maslowcnc for "samples".  Alibaba is only a advertising front middle company  and does not stock anything. Etonm just pays Alibaba for advertising and advertising leads.

bummer

Posted on *2017-06-29 09:19:30* by *davidlang*

use the aliexpress link

---

Posted on *2017-06-29 10:09:32* by *TomTheWhittler*

It looks like those motors are from JIECHUANGSEN Technology CO, LTD.
That link also states "Most of the items we showed are samples.
if you need a big quantity, please feel free to contact us, we will offer the best price for you! "
So they are a large producer of custom motors like Etonm.
It is possible that these would work just as well as the Etonm motors.

Perhaps contact your local vending machine company and find out if they have any junked machines they'd part with, or if you're real lucky sell you something that might work.  Or you could use your search-fu for vending machine repair parts and find an appropriate motor.
