## Cutting sheet metal
Posted on **2017-03-26 22:36:49** by **polyglot**:

There are router bits for sheet metal cutting, so it should work. Just wondering if anyone has tried it. I'd like to cut 20 ga. brass and annealed 20 ga. steel.

probably, the biggest problem with metal like that is going to be holding it in place.

actually, the other possible problem is the speed of the router, the r220 can only slow down so far, which is still several thousand rpm

just use a removable mounting tape like this one free samples to try

I cut 16 gauge aluminum sheet metal all the time with a 3/16 solid carbide SINGLE flute upcut bit works fine. 

I occasionally cut 20 gauge steel, my gut feeling is steel will wear out the bit very fast use soap water spray to help cool the metal or air blower with compressor.  I cut at about 10,000 rpm with palm rounter

aliexpress.com sells the single flute bits for cheap. my guess is most USA distributors are just buying Chinese and marking up 4x the cost.

with steel I always cut relief holes every 1/2. I know it works for small cut outs less than 1x2", not sure how well it works for big pieces never tried that.  You will have to make a very thin sled so the bit is not protruding more than 1/2" and also tighten the bit down extremely well. but extra collets because they will get worn down. Due to how hard steel is the bit is constantly being pulled down and can slowly be yanked out. Since the Chinese collets are so inexpensive I've also used red locktite to permanently glue the bits into them. prevents pullout.

if you start noticing the router vibrating like crazy its typically because the bit is being pulled out and causing unbalanced rotation.
