## Rigid Router depth knob
Posted on **2017-03-26 19:36:49** by **boandersen**:

Y'all, on the rigid I have (I bought mine as a refurb, but it looked nice). The depth control takes a lot of effort to turn when I want to retract the bit. Is that normal?

Should I try oiling the inside cylinder or something? I'm worried  that the z-motor will jam it..

I recall hearing that there was an adjustment screw that affected how tight the depth control knob was.  I don't have one of my own yet to check.

I would try playing with the latch on the side. There should be a nut as part of the latch mechanism that will let you adjust the force applied by the latching mechanism. You want to adjust it so that there is enough force to keep the router from wobbling, but not so much force that it's hard to adjust the depth.

.005 thin UMHW tape will make the depth control silky smooth,  just line inside of cylinder.  hopefully this is thin enough that adjustment latch will still work      alternatively  you can always take some fine 400 grit or higher sand paper and car wax to make the cylinder and holder's contact area as smooth as can be

I've never tried above but should work in theory.

I'm a big fan of Johnson's Paste wax for this kind of thing. I refurbished a thickness planer this weekend and used it liberally. You can turn the height adjustment knob by gluing a mosquito to it and asking him nicely to flying in circles.

Can confirm the paste wax trick, do the depth-screw threads while you're at it. Not quite mosquito-light, but very much improved.
