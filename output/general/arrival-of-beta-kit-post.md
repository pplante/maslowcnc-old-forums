Pick mine up yesterday at their shop. I am fortunate to live a few miles away.

Just got mine out of the mailbox a couple hours ago.  It's sitting unopened behind me while I get ready to tackle it this afternoon.



SO STOKED!

Came home today to a great surprise!

I know they were shipping the international ones first.  Where are you guys located?

NO WAY!  I just sent my son out to the mailbox and low and behold, IT'S HERE!! :)

Just unpacked mine, verified parts, and am hoping to make the trip to getvplywood et al in the morning! Missing one washer, but I'm sure I've a suitable floating around the shop :) can't wait to dive in!



(I'm in Atlanta,GA, btw, and glad my Maslow was coming from the west and not the northeast! I think I've a package stuck in a snowbank somewhere up there...)

Mine also arrived tonight! The bolts in the large and medium bags punctured the bags. Half of each bags contents were loose in the box. Great job taping all edges of the box, so I don't think anything was lost.  Everything else in the box is excellent.  I'm off to Home Depot before they close for the night.  BTW - Also in Atlanta,GA

I was about to comment that the packaging was very good. The -box- looked like it had been around the world eleven times -- all the corners and edges were rounded off, but the tape held and the contents were in place and completely intact. Yours must have gotten some particularly nasty handling. I once saw an aircraft baggage handler throw a stroller about 15' onto pavement. The debris field of broken parts and pieces spread another few yards. 'Ooopsie.' He looked at it for a second or two, then turned back to his 'job' and looked for something else to throw. Some people simply don't give a crap.

Received mine yesterday, all in good condition.  Haven't checked all the parts yet, but am going to try building the frame today.

---

Received mine too. Have not verified parts yet but there is no documentation nor link on where to find it. A clue would be nice as I cannot find it on the forum either.

@elcoyote - there should be a sheet of paper in the box with the complete parts / packing list

---

Great suggestion!

@elcoyote you are looking for the assembly guide here: http://www.maslowcnc.com/assemblyguide . You are right that there should be a link to the guide in the box but we didn't start writing the guide until after the packages were on the way.

Thanks. I finally found it. I suggest placing number references on your pictures. It would make it easier to identify the components. If the end goal is to make this accessible to anyone,  the instructions must be in the most basic of forms. I am already having trouble with the software downloads using Surface Book.

---

Posted on **2017-03-19 14:56:51** by **Bar**:

That's a good suggestion. Keep in mind that all of the instructions are wiki pages so if you think something could be worded more clearly or if you find something which is missing you can edit the page. I'm sure the process will be different on different computers and your contribution could make it easier for the next person.

Quick question, should the beta kit contain the Z axis if we already purchased it? As in, purchased the beta kit and also purchased the Z axis?

I think they are shipping this week.  They were waiting for a part.

Okay was just making sure. Thank you

Not quite here yet, but in country. New Zealand Customs invoice for GST (good and services tax, like country-wide sales tax or VAT) and duties arrived in the mail today. $125 NZD for those curious.

got mine Friday night, just in time to leave town for the weekend for my kiddos. So I FINALLY got to install the software and just do a motor test last night. Unfortunately, I won't get to set up the frame until Sunday... I hate having new toys and not being able to play with them!

---

Posted on **2017-03-28 20:36:43** by **mcginniwa**:

...and the box arrived today. Sadly a combination of things are going to prevent me from digging in until at least the weekend. Looking forward to setting it up though!

Arrived in Bahrain on the 28th March but no notice to me at all. Just went to the Post/Customs office to try my luck and HEY! They found it! The argument with customs was quite tough. Since this parcel contained all components to build a tactical tank, I had to be creative in explaining a hanging CNC. I was asked for a catalog showing the prices and use of each part. The video on the website with Hannah and Bar helped me out. Also the $500 is mentioned there. After explaining that a Kickstarter Project does not actually kick people, Maslow and Molotow are different persons and the devices named after them are for entirely different purposes, I got the parcel released without tax. Excited to get home and check if everything is there :-). Friday and Saturday are booked for the setup and first moves.

Small, but with a little raw material it can -replicate- -itself-!! ;)
