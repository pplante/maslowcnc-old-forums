## MDF cutting example?
Posted on **2016-12-10 21:09:44** by **christophersolar**:

Hi-

Are there any example images for parts cut from MDF? All the pictures I've seen are cuts made in relatively coarse/splintery plywood, so it makes it harder to see what the cut quality/line straightness are like.

Thanks, Chris.

Good question!



Yes. One of our backers sent in this dragon to cut a couple weeks ago and I cut it from MDF core, but we didn't really show any close ups of the cut edges, so here they are.

Oh that's interesting... does that MDF have a veneer on it?

Yeah! It's an MDF core with a walnut veneer. It looks great, cuts great and it's cheap ($22 for a 4x8 sheet)

Wish I could (easily) get stuff like that... The south gets rough plywood unless you go to a specialty place and pay a fortune

Where did you get this wood?

I picked it up from Eden Saw (http://www.edensaw.com/) in Port Townsend, WA. It's a little bit of a specialty place, but they also have great deals and the guys who work there are phenomenal. For anyone in the Pacific North West, it's worth a trip.

I in Arizona so that would be a heck of a lumber run. Is there a brand on it? Maybe they have a distributor closer to me

I looked for a brand mark or a barcode sticker or anything and came up clean. Home depot sells MDF without a veneer or with a veneer which is meant to be written on with dry erase markers, but neither of those have the nice look of natural wood.



Has anyone else seen this stuff in their area?

Honestly, I don't know enough on the terms to figure out what I'm looking at... But their website seems to have a pretty good collection so if it lists that specific item it might have more details on what it is so people can find it locally? http://www.edensaw.com/MainSite/Store1/Store/CategoryHome/370
