## Casters?

How easy would it be to put the Maslow on lockable casters?  This will be used at my school and portability will be key.  Any issues with having it on  wheels?

don't' see why it would be an issue. I think a collapsible aluminum frame would be the best solution though, that wood frame is still pretty massive and probably not needed all the time.  I would also guess that over time in a humid environment the wood might warp enough to cause issues.

You could easily put casters on the bottom, and I agree that a collapsible frame might be even easier. Both good options.
