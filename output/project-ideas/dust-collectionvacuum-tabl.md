## Dust collection/vacuum table design?

I'm new to all of this, but I'm already hoping we can come up with a plywood back cabinet to attach to the Maslow and give us a dust collection/vacuum work table type function.   Can't wait for all of the shared tinkering!

That sounds awesome. Maybe we should have a cabinet contest? Everyone can download the best cabinet design.

The more I think about it, the more I think a cabinet contest is an awesome idea :-)



If everyone who is participating already has a CNC machine, what can we award? Bragging rights? You get your name forever inscribed in the firmware? Maybe a trophy you download and cut yourself?

I've been running with a hose attached to the vacuum port on my router, works well unless I'm near the bottom edge. It doesn't seem to change the motor calibration values much, and it takes care of most of the dust.

I got the 70 gallon dust collector from Harbor Freight. 145 with 20 off coupon they throw out there.  It is awesome for taking the dust out the air, and I hooked a separate hose to the router.  Still have to sweep the heavy stuff off the floor but its cool.
