Hey everybody. Bar and I got to talking about swords this morning (don't ask me how...) and I decided, heck, I'm just gonna cut some! It's something I've been wanting for a few months now. And an hour later... Two swords!  [Swords!](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:jIvv:swords.jpg.jpg)

I asked how she designed them so fast and Hannah said that she picked the first result on google for "Sword SVG" which is a good tip

Halloween is going to be fun next year :-)

the maslow should be able to cut this sort of thing. aligning the board for the cut on the other side will be interesting, but drill a hole as the very last thing on one side, then flip the board and move it until the hole lines up again, then start the other side.
