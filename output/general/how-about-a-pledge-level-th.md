## How about a Pledge Level that includes a Makesmith CNC?

How about a Pledge Level for the Maslow, that will also come with a Make Smith CNC. Then people who didn't get a Makesmith can still work on big and small projects.

Oooo cool idea!



Putting together the Makesmith kits was a ton of work, especially all the hours of laser cutting. I want to focus on getting all the Maslow kits out as quickly as possible, but I think I have a solution. 



What if we designed a small open source desktop CNC which you could "print" using your Maslow? We would use the Maslow controller and software. It doesn't even need to be a reward level, just a free download.



What do you think?

That would be pretty cool to, DO IT!

I'd vote for that... I wondered if the Makesmith could be cut by the Maslow, but don't know enough about the Makesmith

If you end up doing a new version of the makesmith, I there there are a lot of interesting things to look at doing.



I've finally gotten around to assembling my makemsith just a few days ago and am working through the kinks.



but one thing is instead of getting the position as a pwn signal (2 wires) and then having to digitize that, get it through the i2s bus (4 wires) and then you can get the full 0.4 degree accuracy of the sensors



But that sort of thing should probably be a different topic on it's own :-)
