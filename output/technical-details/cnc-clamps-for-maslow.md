## CNC clamps for Maslow?

Do you think it would be possible/practical to use a gridded panel and some clamps like this on Maslow? https://youtu.be/bpJyqLoqV04
I'm curious if Maslow would need to always work with 4x8' panels, or if dimensional lumber and small pieces could be used.

Will we also be able to put limit boundaries in software for the router. So that if we use clamps or smaller then 4x8 sheets the router won't go somewhere we don't want it to go.

You can absolutely work with pieces smaller than 4x8. I could see a gridded panel working really well. You could even use the router to drill the evenly spaced holes for the threaded inserts

It looks like Marius doesn't even use threaded inserts in his newer design.  This looks really useful.  Thanks for sharing!
