## Suitable for building furniture grade built-ins?
Posted on **2017-06-25 10:53:34** by **rexw**:

This project looks fantastic and has a lot of potential. When I saw the hanging router I initially discounted it as a hobby grade tool, but I read that repeatability is 1/64" so I wonder if it can handle furniture grade plywood and required dados?  Any feedback from users doing this sort of thing?

right now we are still in the beta-test stage, the accuracy is currently not up to the 1/64" goal. The expectation is that this will be suitable for furniture building, there's definitely no reason why it would have any problem with furniture grade plywood (or other wood for that matter)



dados are no problem

A downcutting spiral cutter could help create clean dados. This project is excellent!

My current goal is a Lift desk utilizing only 1 and the entire sheet with minimum waste. The 4 horizontal supports for the desk I have in the design are in the centre of the sheet, aligned vertically. My snap-in in spring joints (no screws needed) would be at the top and the bottom. If I would cut them with the Maslow right now, I would not expect a perfect fit, as those are areas that improvements are worked on. (so I hope)

[Lift-desk](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:qCLS:liftdesk.jpg.jpg)  This are the horizontal supports of the desk. On the sheet (orange) they are vertical. Cutting 'spring-joints' in the down part will work. (So I believe) On the top I have my doubts. As a workaround, with mounted guides, I could flip the sheet and cut the top joints now down. I have taken the rest of the design out till I have cut it ;-)
