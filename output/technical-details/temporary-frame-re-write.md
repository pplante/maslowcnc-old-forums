## Temporary Frame Re-Write
Posted on **2017-06-29 21:20:33** by **Bar**:

Hey Everyone!



I've just re-written the temporary frame assembly instructions based on all the things we've learned over the past weeks. I know it's been quite a while since many of you did the build process, but I would love feedback if anyone has a second to look them over. 



The big changes are switching to the new slanted 2x4 design for the arms, adding motor mounting pieces to move the motors out and a chain guide to reduce chain skipping on the temporary frame, and adding a drill as a needed tool.



You can find the updated instructions here: https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/How-To-Assemble-The-Temporary-Frame



Let me know what you think, or edit the wiki directly :-)

I've been proofreading it and making a few minor changes.  



On step 7, the words "hole facing out and away from the plywood" are a little confusing since there are multiple pieces of plywood on the assembly at that time.  I think a picture from the same perspective as in step 6 might clarify the placement a little.



On step 19, out of curiosity, why do we use a cup hook to mount the pulley rather than a screw?

I've been seeing your changes and they are FANTASTIC! Thank you so much for taking the time to look them over.



I completely agree about step 7. I will update the picture perspective and make the wording more clear. Great recommendation.



For step 19, you are absolutely right that we could use a screw, and it would probably even work better. That little pulley falls off when you take the stretchy string off and it's annoying to have to put back on. We would probably need to add a spacer to keep the pulley from rubbing on the wood, but we can do that. Also a great recommendation. I'm not going to change it for this batch because the boxes are packed :-), but going forward I think we should get rid of that cup hook and use a screw.



Again, thank you so much for taking the time to look those over, and for the excellent suggestions!

I signed up for a GitHub account so I could add to the wiki, however after editing a page I got a 404 and now my account is flagged?

What I wanted to add is an explanation of a 2x4: A milled 2x4 is 48 x 98 mm in Europe and 38 x 89 mm in the United States. The unmilled dimensions are almost the same: 50 x 100 mm in Europe and 50.8 mm x 101.6 mm in the United States

Interesting. US 2x4s were downsized in the early 1970s. I wonder if the European dimensions more closely match the old standard...



So what are the practical ramifications of the different standards for Maslow users?

@jwolter0 From the pictures I would say nothing, as nothing connects to width or thickness. Length you cut yourself. Interesting that US mills them down so much.

Our boxes of cereal are smaller too, same price. :)

I own a 100+ year old house (yes, I( know that's new for Europe but it's old here :) ) partly built of rough 16 foot 2x4s - the other part is broadaxe hewn logs - and they vary half an inch/25mm from 4 inches.  It worked with rough lath and plaster, but drywall takes a big stack of different size shims and repairs take cutting down a 2x"6".  I'll take the current size planed ones even if they are a bit skimpy and some scribbling and cutting to figure out how to make something 2 feet wide.



Prior to the 70s the "dimensioned" 2x4s were undersized, just not as much - 1 3/4 by 3 3/4, and my dad complained about them in our post war 1940s house.  New houses built with the shrunk ones seem to stay upright so it must work.

I need to correct my statement on 2 minor points. The motor mount plates, ergo the motors, will be closer to the sheet in US compared to Europe, assuming you align them with the back of the 2x4. If you want to cut at the bottom of the sheet, you need to take a bit of the back of the down 2x4 out, in order for the sled to move over it. In Europe you need to take out more then in the US.

@mooselake, I love the "blade loss" explanation. That's why my cuts are smaller :-)

reading through the frame setup, I have a comment.



If the floor isn't level, having the flat 2x4's at the bottom of the feet will make the machine more likely to rock/twist. you could put small feet below that (ideally adjustable ones), or you could move the bottom 2x4 up just a bit.

another thought I had. Many people who are going to be building this will have a table saw available, so it would be a good idea to make a set of instructions for building the final frame with a table saw and skip the temporary frame entirely.

Exactly!  Having maslow make tge parts seems really ineffcient

I have plenty of woodworking tools and would love to skip making the temporary frame and just get to building the permanent frame without having to cut the parts first.

To be honest, there's nothing about the permanent frame that requires or even is particularly suited to a CNC router. We built our permanent frame a month or so ago using a table saw and miter saw. You will want to get the dimensions for the gussets from the Sketchup model or improvise, knowing that the work surface is 15 degrees from vertical.

the reason for having the maslow cut it's parts is because we can't assume that the person building it has any other tools.



For those interested in building the permanent frame, just build a couple a-frames at 10-15 degrees slope and attach the final backer to them (or build the 'wall style' rectangular frame, which is stronger but uses more wood)

does it matter if the temporary sled is a true 8.5x11?  I printed mine from acrobat and used a poster style layout -- 2 pieces of paper taped together.  The example sled template, that came in the box, was printed with margins making it smaller than 8.5x11.  Does it matter which one I use?

No, it shouldn't matter. The calibration process will take care of any size differences. Great question!
