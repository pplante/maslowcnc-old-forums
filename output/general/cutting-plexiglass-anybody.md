Yes you can with a router, but you will need bits designed to cut plastic

yes, you need special bits, otherwise it just melts and makes a mess, but it will work fine.

Typically you'd use O-flute bits on plastic. They should be available in most regular sizes.

My father use to work for Rohm & Haas, they made plexiglass so of course everything in our house was repaired with plexiglass and yes it melts bad...we used a jigsaw and a polish wheel which really didn't work too well so glad to see there is better tech for today's apps
