So when we are going to start cutting, we should first open arduino, and then open ground control?

You actually only need to open Arduino to update the firmware so to cut you just need to open Ground Control

In fact, I always check that Arduino isn't running - it can keep the serial port captured so that GroundControl can't get it.
