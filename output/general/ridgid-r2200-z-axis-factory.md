## Ridgid R2200 z-axis factory knob removal
Posted on *2017-03-27 17:50:58* by *mindeye*

Just a heads up for those needing to know - the factory knob is attached with a T10 torx screw down inside the knob, or at least mine was. The repair manual doesn't actually specify anything besides M3.5 x 12mm.
