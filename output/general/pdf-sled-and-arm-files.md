## PDF sled and arm files
Posted on **2017-03-22 11:18:38** by **hnatkowicz**:

I am planning to start this tonight with my son. I was hoping to find files for the Maslow as I see it in the videos, complete. I would really rather skip the tempory version and just fabricate from patterns. A PDF file would be fantastic, or even a straight on photo so I can scale from the 4' x 8' sheet of plywood, and create my own patterns would be fine as well. Any help would be appreciated. I am excited and want to print the patterns before he gets home from school.

Fantastic timing! I just put them all into a zip folder to make them easier to download. You can grab the folder [here](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/blob/master/AllPartsSVG.zip) they are .svg files, not PDFs because the idea is that you would cut them on the machine. If you have trouble printing them as is, you can easily convert to PDF files [here](https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-pdf). I would do it for you, but I've already used up all my free conversions for the week :-)

The .svg files are a little shaky. Meaning, the curves are not smooth when I import them into CorelDraw. But, I will clean them up and they will work. Thanks!!!

That's not ideal. Can you post a screen shot so I can see what they look like?

I am guessing it might create a little chatter when routing?
