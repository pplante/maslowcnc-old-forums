## Fully automatic
Posted on **2017-03-26 15:12:41** by **blsteinhauer88**:

Picked up my Z access the other day and installed. Got my numbers right finally and have a circle. Decided to try a quick project on "full auto" .   Took one and a half hours, but turned out great and I cut it on the extreme left side of the plywood without any trouble. Now going to cut my frame.

Are the Z-Axis units shipping yet?  Still waiting for mine.

They are shipped! (Friday actually) it seems like things are moving so fast these days that even a weekly update isn't enough :)

@bar, just don't plan on taking a day off over the weekend in the near future, That when things really get busy :-)

you could come back after a weekend away and not recognize things :-)

Which motor connection on the board did you end up using? I've tried both 2 and 4 since 1 an 3 are occupied by left / right but I'm getting nothing in GC and I manually edited groundcontrol.ini to set zaxis = True

Looks like maybe my config was bad - in main.py it's zAxis instead of zaxis...

Would one of you post a photo of how to assemble the z-axis?

I used the YouTube z axis closeup video but I'll see if I can get a photo up here shortly too.

Here's two quick pics of the installed z-axis:

Ok, interestingly enough my z-in and z-out buttons don't work but test motors is clearly actuating the z-axis motor... ? I guess I'll run a test cut and see how it does.

No dice. Test motors clearly actuates the z-axis but both the controls in GC and running a file do not actually use the z-axis.

---

Posted on **2017-03-27 20:07:31** by **mindeye**:

The correct motor connection for the z-axis is 2 where 4 is closest to the power / usb connections. At least for test motors... still doesn't work when running g-code or using the GC controls.

Latest version of GC fixed the issue.

Got mine installed and twirling around today.  Very satisfying!
