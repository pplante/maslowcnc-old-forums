I know it would probably take more than 15 minutes to recreate Wintergatan's Marble Machine? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q), but that is an awesome build.

Oh man. I've probably watched that 100 times since I first saw it. He has several music contraptions and they're all fascinating!
