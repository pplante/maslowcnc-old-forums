## Check your wooden arms and U joint brackets.

I was having issues with sagging, the sled would "relax" downward at the end of a cut, leaving a divot in the wood from the bit.  I happened to look up at the arms when unhooking the sled from chains.  I saw the arms, raise!   I'm not an engineer, but that can't bee good on the math.  



I found my u bolts were loose, and my 2x4 arms were splitting after drying.  I figured that part of the problem is when I went through the setup calibration, after measuring the chain length, the next says to retract or release.  I was thinking, retract means back up, but it tightened the chains more.  This is where likely the over-stress on the arms happened and loosened everything to the motormounts.  



I ran some screws through the arms to hold them together, and re tightened the U bolts.  Hence the sled was supported again.  Check yours and I will be adding the "Maslow Arms".  I really think they will add better support to the whole arms system.

Photo also added a chain step guide so it keeps it inline with the motor sprocket.  Had chain slipping during a cut top center.

Your step guide is a good idea. Thanks for sharing it :)

There is a lot of flex in those motor mounts.

I intend to build the frame much more line rancher's frame as shown in the April 19 update (  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1830738289/maslow-cnc-a-500-open-source-4-by-8-foot-cnc-machi/posts/1863568 )



I really don't like the motors only being supported by the arms attached to the plywood, that seems far too flexible. A nice rectangular frame where the tension between the motors pulls them towards each other against a solid piece of wood (no pivoting possible) seems FAR stronger, and by adding even a 1/4" or 1/8" piece of plywood across the back, you can drastically improve the stiffness of the machine

Yes that would be ideal.

My next session in the shop I intend to fasten cleats to the wall and screw 2x4 lateral supports from the motor mount arms to the wall behind the machine.  Even though my machine is rigid in x/y, the arms can be pulled ever so slightly "inwards" which messes up alignment and creates noise in the cut.
