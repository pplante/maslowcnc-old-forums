## How small can this go

Been looking for a cnc for my shop and I like this idea but I don't understand how well this will scale down.  For example, if I wanted to make a monogram for my daughter that is 3" long on 1/8" thick wood is that too small or a project?  I don't see how the maslow could perform on a small scale.

Check out the Root2CNC.

You can certainly cut something that small, but it's not really our target application and I think you can find a machine which would be better for that. I'd maybe check out the shapeoko3 if you want a tool which can cut some pretty big stuff and still do detail engraving type work. That root2CNC looks pretty sweet too. Edward Ford is the guy who runs shapeoko and he was the original pioneer of that design with the belts and rails that most of the bench top machines use these days.

My first thought about Maslow was 'WOW THAT'S BIG!!!' On the minus side it's -too- big for a -lot- of people. I would make a smaller version either 2x4 or 3x6. Maybe not the 2x4 so much but for 3x6 this is a good style rather than desktop.

Thats a good idea. Make Maslow scalable from 4x8 to say 4x4 to maybe 2x2.

I had the same thought. Or maybe someone wants to go bigger to say paint a mural on a wall. 



The software lets you define how big you want your machine to be and does all the necessary calculations based on your input :-)

That's genius. Wall Painting robot.

Couldn't you just dedicate a 4x8 to be a template for smaller materials? Have a 2x4 rectangle profile cut out of the center and then clamp your smaller board inside and define the right starting point for the file?

jgunnr, there's no need for that. (Actually I don't quite understand what you mean by cut out the center. The material to be cut needs to be fastened to something.) The machine can cut down to any size within the 4x8 workspace. There are a number of ways to fasten a piece of material to the main board. For something small/light that might get pushed around by the router, I suggest using T-nuts on the back side of the main board, and a short length of wood on the topside with a screw through it to clamp down. If that doesn't make sense I can draw a picture. You can look up milling machine clamping systems.
