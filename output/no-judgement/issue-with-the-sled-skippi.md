## Issue with the sled "skipping" during cuts
Posted on *2017-04-30 18:45:34* by *nickandj*

So we've had an issue with the machine in which halfway through a cut, the sled starts jumping up or down of the intended cut path.  Not sure if it's a sled issue, a motor issue or an issue with the file itself.  Sometimes we could cut our plywood with no "skipping" and then on the next round of cutting its starts jumping again.  I've attached a couple photos to show the problem.  Has anyone else experienced this?

that looks like the chain is slipping on the sporckets. can you watch that and see if that is what's happening?

I agree with @davidlang I would guess that the chain is slipping. It happens fast so it can help to film the motor to see it

Its an issue that seems like it can have a couple causes and solutions. We're going to be shipping all of you an extra part that we added which helps more of the chain wrap around the sprocket. If you don't want to wait, you could make something similar to [our solution](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:7mKk:screenshot_20170430190524.png.jpg) 

It can also help to make sure that the chain is feeding smoothly onto the sprockets and that everything is kept in plane
