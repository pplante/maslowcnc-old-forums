## Z-Axis Home Setting?
Posted on **2017-03-30 16:50:08** by **rancher**:

Hey, so, I'm probably missing it, as is my way.  I'm hoping there is a way to set the height of Z-axis Home as a relationship to stock top or sled bottom or something.  Or maybe I'm thinking about it all wrong.  I've started to sort out height settings in the output from Fusion360, but I don't know where I'm starting from.  To my mind that seems like something we should be able to set in GC settings.  What am I missing?

Great question.



You are looking for the "Zero Z" button near the arrow keys in Ground Control. It will set the z-axis position to 0 so the intended use is to jog the z-axis down until it touches the surface of the wood, then click "Zero Z" to let the machine know where the surface of the wood is.

Ah, that makes sense.  I had used that function the other day and wondered if it was setting home or going home.  Setting home.  Thank you Bar.

So Zero is the face of the surface to be cut right?

Yes, generally zero is the surface

I've noticed that the z-in and z-out buttons move the bit 10% of the setting in the distance box. A 4" setting will move z by .4" - set a much smaller value to sneak up on the surface.

Good comment! There is an issue filed for creating a separate distance button for the z-axis distance which I think will make that more clear.
