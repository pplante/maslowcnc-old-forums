Okay, this may be a stretch but, I have an idea I can't wait to try out... Check out the video I made a few years ago, for reference, and I am sure you can imagine where my brain has taken me from there... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgtOvBiw4vU  I currently use the cutawl for acrylic, aluminum, wood, and pretty much anything, due to the freely rotating cutting head, and the ability to freely move around on any size pattern. The drawback is, you need to drill a hole in the center of closed objects, to insert the blade.

That is one cool tool! I'd never seen one of those before. I can't wait to see how it turns out.



Other than the thing about the needing a hole to start I think you have a real chance. I'm really excited to see how it works with some of the materials which are harder to cut using a router (like aluminum). Because the force of that blade is into and out of the material I bet it has a different set of strengths and weaknesses than a rotating bit which could expand the machine's capabilities. 



The entire router sled it attached with two quick release pins, for easy servicing, but you could easily just have two sleds one for the Kutawl and one for a router and switch between them.



Thanks for sharing that!
