## Angle brace dimensions
Posted on **2017-05-07 11:14:33** by **boandersen**:

Hopeing someone has a cheat sheet.

I had so many bad cuts in my sheet of plywood that I decided to stop after cutting sled arms and motor mounts.
I figured I could easily cut the angle braces with a circular saw.. 

So I am looking for a list of the length of the sides of each of the braces. 

I know I can do the hard work and get it out of sketchup, but maybe someone had already done this

I started to try to pull the dimensions for you, then I realized how irregular they are so I started going through and cleaning them up to try to get nice round numbers, then I realized that we are going to end up with some strange numbers to get a 15 degree angle no matter what.

I'm taking the idea that the legs should be easier to construct using hand tools to heart, and I'm going to keep thinking about how to make that easier. 

For now, I think you are probably best off winging it with the goal of getting around a 15 degree tilt. Trying to measure everything out to the strange dimensions of the CAD model is going to be a waste of your time. Hitting exactly a 15 degree angle is not critical.

You can follow along with my process of simplifying the design to be easier to build by hand [here](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/tree/Add-new-design-option) in the New Machine Design sketchup file if you'd like.

Thanks - I will try to hack my way through it using printouts to approximate angles.. I think I'll be pretty close.

I did not mean to put anyone to work..

Bar, there is nothing magic about the 15 degree tilt, plan things out for nice round numbers for the dimenstions that are approximatly 15 degrees (or if we decide that steeper is better, 10 degrees or whatever)

Bar, in the "New Machine Design", are the motor mounts the same as in the original? It looks like they get wood-screwed in place, yes? It looks like I can take locating measurements for them and for the arms from the drawing. Any advice about fastener locations? Have you tried the latest measurement routine on these arms, or does that need to be tested?

I took the original motor mounts and repurposed them, I may redesign them soon. The arms are 100cm long and leave the corners of the machine at a 45 degree angle, details in the SketchUp model. I used eight screws in both the motor mounts and at the base of the arms, but thats probably excessive.

I would love your thoughts if you try the new system. I've been very pleased so far.

Here are some motor mounts i reverse engineered, I plan on having the finished structure built before i get all the hardware  [Arm Layout](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:yazb:armlayout.jpg.jpg)

that's a lot of bracing on the frame legs, there really isn't that much force on them.

the 3/4" is more for an option to have a logo engraved. but it simplifies all the small cuts. plus i plan on cutting alot of mdf which is 95lbs. i rather it be over built. Also thinking of adding a few angles under the motor mounts. Figure it can't hurt [Motor Support](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:9iWX:motorsupport.jpg.jpg)

you don't need triangle braces on both sides of the legs at the top. You could probably get by quite nicely with a piece of filler between the 2x4s or an angled cut on one and just screws from one to the other (probably even with just the screws). one brace near the bottom, one near the middle would give you all the strength you need to keep the legs from collapsing (there is probably more need for a horizontal and/or diagonal brace between one A-frame and the next than more bracing on one A-frame)
