## Kickstarter charge
Posted on *2016-11-23 11:05:51* by *TheRiflesSpiral*

Just FYI for backers; my account was charged yesterday for Maslow! It was the correct amount and there were no issues, I just wanted to remind everyone the campaign is over and it's time to pay up!

Let's give the Maslow team and their Beta Testers all the support we can in the time that will pass between now and the first round of shipments!
