## 4th Axis Ideas
Posted on *2017-01-08 12:47:20* by *dom_e_uk*

Hey guys,

As we've now got a 4th Axis for free (thanks Bar), I thought it'd be a good idea to start a thread about any ideas anyone's got.....

I'm slowly trying to work out a method of tilting the z-axis with stepper motors! In essence I'm toying with the idea of having the sled (in contact with the surface) mounted at the corners on screw threads which join it onto the main sled (with the router on it).  Clearly for a right angled z-axis movement, all the motors would descend at the same rate.  But what it may enable, is angled cuts (roughly worked out to 35 degrees depending on the router plunge depth).

I'm torn between a number of ways to control it :- 
        - The GPIO ports joined to an H-bridge?
       - The Z axis's controlling opposite corners, but inhibiting the motor that isn't to be actioned (probably by using the GPIO again.

These are just my ideas, any advice or expansion is welcome...... Just fancy doing more with an extra axis than attaching a pen!
