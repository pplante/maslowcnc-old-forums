## any chance a new forum can be made?, this format is lacking
Posted on **2017-07-02 12:09:18** by **rollandelliott**:

I've been on many forums. Most of the modern ones show photos and videos and are much easier to navigate. IMHO this forum needs a make over. it's very annoying to use.

I would prefer NOT to have videos as a general rule, this forum support photos fairly well.



But I agree that this forum software is very poor, it really discourages searches, and has no provisions for a FAQ or pinned posts, so we end up with many repetitive threads.



It's easy to see everything new that is posted, but the other forums usually have a way to do that as well (and some of them have the ability to subscribe via e-mail and reply via e-mail, which makes it very easy to watch everything and respond later if needed)

I feel qualified to say that it's not noob-friendly.  As Hannah and I have discussed, most of the conversation you find on here is legit detailed optimization and application of maslow use, some of it getting pretty nitty gritty.  There's no Beginners Read First thread, so it looks pretty intimidating.



And yeah, I don't get the search function.  Does it actually work?

Search does not work for me. Tried to find the thread with 'PID tuning' and gave up.

It works for some definition of works :-)



I've been able to use it to track down threads I remembered, but you have to have a pretty solid idea of what you are looking for, which rules out finding if your question has already been asked.



@davidfryauf, there is the "no judgements" section, but since the main view that people tend to watch is 'all posts' (and therefor people don't put much effort into putting a post into the correct channel, and many belong in multiple channels), that doesn't really help much.

Yeah, I agree. Muut is not the best. I support the idea to move to something else.



We did a phpBB system for Makesmith and I wasn't that stoked on it. It took a ton of hours to get set up, had a lot of spam bot problems, and had to be hosted on a separate website because our web host Squarespace couldn't support it. 



Recommendations

for other forum services to look into?

As a forum member/user, I really like XenForo

https://xenforo.com/

I've never set it up so no idea on that part.

Great suggestion! I wasn't aware of that one. I'll look into the setup side

BAen books uses FUDForum, and ties it into e-mail so that people can treat it like a series of mailing lists if they want.



they have it up at bar.baen.com (free registration required to access it)

I sort of prefer the muut format for discussion purposes. It keeps the most active/recent threads "in your face" and feels much more conversational than a phBB style board. It doesn't lend itself to archival or knowledge retention purposes but I think that's what the wiki is for. Discussion here, solutions there.



Anyway, I'm up for whatever, just tossing in my $0.02

Check out [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org). Hosting is free for open source projects, I believe. [Open source](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) as well.

Drunk as I am I will just throw this in:

From my past experience, I would ask a question in here and it was answered. Are we expecting new Maslowians to use the crappy search function here, or better searches on other platforms? I don't think so.

What kept me alive and active was the prompt response from the fantastic community and I have no issues with answering the same question over and over again.

It is valuable feedback on what parts of the Wiki or tutorials to address improvements. The 'No Judgment' was a great addition.

All I have to do is to save links to forum threads that are important to me. A simple text file can do that. Commenting on old topics will 'Bump' it up to the top again.

@gero I like your Willing to repeatedly answer the same question. That I feel should always be the core belief of a open source community. I wanted to like your comment for that, but can't as a better Forum Setup would be welcome. I would have systematically ingested this forum for all it's precious knowledges had there been an effective search feature and Pinned posts.

Posted on **2017-07-05 22:41:31** by **davidlang**:

I don't mind answering the same question multiple times, but there are lots of cases where I will do a lot of digging and provide a lot of links in a post, and I don't usually keep track of all of that work to provide the same thing the next time the topic comes up. Sometimes my new answer is better, sometimes not. (see feeds and speeds posts for great examples of this)

With the flood of kits going out I'm pretty sure this forum is going to see a flood of new people in here as well. Confusion shall reign!

---

Posted on **2017-07-07 10:05:42** by **rollandelliott**:

exactly, I don't mind answering stuff over and over, but when 10x more people are on this forum it's going to get run down and become useless in it's current format.

I wanted to make sure this didn't fall off the radar. I'm working on getting a discourse based forum up and running, so I haven't forgotten about this request. It might take me a couple more days before I have something to show, but I wanted yall to know I hear the request and I think its a great idea :-)

Yup, time to move on :O  [666](/images/q3/5o/q35o_666.jpg.jpg)

Once the new forum is up and running, we should go through this one and reply to the best threads with a "bump" to move them  to the top of the archives.

---

Posted on **2017-07-15 11:43:14** by **mrfugu**:

please keep an eye open to potential wiki pages as well, especially for well established solutions/procedures.

+1 @mrfugu.  That was one of the drivers of my comment.  Once the community had chosen the best threads, I was going to mine them for wiki material.  I have been trying to add to and clean up the wiki where I could. As a school user, I'll be one of the last to receive a kit, but I want to contribute to the community in some way.

nice, @jwolter, learn them Kiddos good!
