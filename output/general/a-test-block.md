## a test block

You don't need Fusion360 to view designs stored at a360.co. This address simply opens the file in probably some sort of java viewer. If you have Fusion it's downloadable, or maybe a copy function to put it in your own account, I don't remember.

The design is set to make a 3x3 block in 3/4" material using a 1/4" bit, but it's parameter driven so those dimensions are easily changed.
I looked for a plywood texture, but it's not there so I think I grabbed MDF. It would have been interesting to see that the outer square step cuts go halfway through the middle layer of plywood. That'd be a good suggestion for the Autodesk folks to create.
What's *NOT* seen in the online design view is shown in screencap attached below. There's a little 'inverted T' on the sides of the top step. The diameter of the inner cutout is exactly the same size as the top half of the block, and it cuts halfway down that top level. What that T means is that the bit just barely cuts through the side of the wall of the depression in the top. This is an excellent test because it's bey ond the limits of the wood! If there's any wall thickness remaining, that means the diameter of the depression cut in the top was too small. If there's a 'gap' cut out that means the diameter of the depression was too large. If there's some cutout and some remaining, that means the diameter was spot on.
To save cut time I was -trying- to not cut out the entire top depression, but that seemed to involve laying a sketch on a sketch and wasn't working right so I stopped trying. It's still a valid test because it will show how smooth/level the bottom cutout surface it. It's later, and I think I know how I was supposed to do that, but I'll leave it go for now.
This is a 'tiny-local' test. A wider test would be to cut out these kinds of test shapes from the center of a full sheet, and others in the four corners, and along the four sides at the middles.

If you have a gcode for that, I can run it tonight in the different spots.
