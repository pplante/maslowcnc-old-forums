## CNC cut plywood lamp
Posted on **2017-03-02 02:08:37** by **thomasgkristensen**:

I have been searching all over the place for some lamps for my lounge and I stumbled upon these amazing plywood lamps: https://www.behance.net/gallery/29273877/fire-of-dragon



I was hoping to have a go at cutting and assembling a lamp like this myself, but I don't (yet) have the design skills for pulling this one off myself. I've searched high and low for template files for something like this but with no luck.



Does anyone know of a plywood lamp with available files out there? Or alternatively, are there any projects like this I can start out with to get a feeling for how these things are generally assembled?



I'm thinking this would be perfect for 3mm plywood.



Thanks!

I found this one on thingiverse which might be a good starting point: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2089166

That is gorgeous!



It might be worth reaching out to the creator to see if they might be interested in either sharing or selling the plans. I've found that if I ask nicely people take it as a compliment even if they say no.

Yes, of course :-) I've already emailed him and I'm eagerly awaiting his response.

the files are downloadable on thingverse, and are under the cc non-commercial share-alike license



which means you can't seel the plans, or sell the lamps made from the plans, but you can download, modify, and pass around the designs.

Man... what a beauty. I've got some 1/4 Walnut just dying for a project like that.



... and the project list groooooowwwwws!

Oh wow Thomas, that lamp is just awesome!! I'm definitely going to have a go at that one, maybe a few through the house if they look as good as that! Thank you!

Hey David, I didn't follow you about the Thingiverse license? Can you dumb it down for me please...

Creative Commons Licensing is a standardized way of creating a license to let people know what you allow them to do with your design.



https://creativecommons.org/licenses/



The pictures under the license listing on thingverse (and the text under it) is for the CC BY-NC-SA license



CC = Creative Commons

BY = Attribution required (you have to give the original designer credit, you can't claim you did the design yourself)

NC = Non Commercial

SA = Share Alike, which means that you are allowed to distribute modified versions of this design.



or as the license page summarizes it:



This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.



This means that you don't need to ask for permission to make one of these (unless you are doing it to sell them), and you are allowed to distribute the design files (put them on any website), and can modify them and distribute the modified files as well.



so the creator has already granted permission for the files to be put in any co llection (as long as they aren't sold)



Personally, I don't like the non-commercial tag, it can get messy to define exactly what is commercial use of a design, so I like people to use CC BY-SA.

Hey David, thanks for taking time out to explain all that. Cheers, Michael

I think we have a little confusion here, The "Fire of dragon" on Behance (first link) does not appear to Creative Common but the one "wooden Pineapple Lamp" on thingiverse (second link) is under the creative common tag. I would prefer the "Fire of dragon" one myself.

Note: betterblock.org (wikiblock) has free (dxf) files under Creative Commons. Tomthewhittler, I can't find ref to cc either on that Adobe site, given the nature of the site - to show off the use of their various software products by world famous designers/architects/etc etc - I wouldn't expect to. The site is totally mesmerising in any case.

Nothing Adobe is free. I'm surprised they don't have a paywall just to visit adobe.com

This one might actually be easier to reproduce: https://www.behance.net/gallery/43840109/lykke



I can't figure out how the other one is assembled...

---

Posted on **2017-03-06 10:49:23** by **TomTheWhittler**:

Well there is nothing stopping one of us to "borrow" the design and whip it up into a "community free" stl file.

So many fun things we can do with the Maslowcnc. Now if we only had it in our hands...

---

Posted on **2017-03-06 12:26:45** by **Bar**:

@TheRiflesSpiral I couldn't see how it goes together either, which is weird because he even shows all the parts.



@TomTheWhittler We can't wait to see you have machines either : ) . We're trying to get hardware into community hands as soon as humanly possible!

---

Posted on **2017-03-06 12:36:41** by **TomTheWhittler**:

Sorry Bar. Was not pushing.. Okay.. maybe a tiny little ;)

I know you are doing everything as humanly possible. Keep up the great work. No complaints from me at all. Your are doing excellent especially compared to some of my other supported Kickstarter campaigns. This campaign has been the best so far.

This is one of those projects where you can see so many possibilities and we are like little kids in a candy store. So many flavors. So many types. We want to taste them all.

---

Posted on **2017-03-06 12:59:42** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

@Bar I wonder if it's a bit of clever misdirection... more parts than are necessary or even parts from a different design substituted just to obfuscate the assembly.

---

Posted on **2017-03-06 13:40:00** by **TomTheWhittler**:

I think it is all there without any extra parts. At least I think I can see how it goes together.  The parts with the metal brackets on top is the very top of the lamp and slides into the pieces just to the right of the light bulb at very top of the three slot area. I think there is only six of those. So the very top is held by every other one of those pieces to the right. One of the larger rings is next in line but connects up to all the pieces to the right and bottom of the bulb. The next slot is for another large ring and the bottom is for another large ring. The Fan outs are attached to all those pieces attached to the rings.

Posted on **2017-03-07 20:24:52** by **spatialguy**:

FYI, I emailed the designer of the 'Fire of Dragon' asking about use of hi file, here is his response...

"Hi Michael,



Thank you for showing interest in my work. Fire of Dragon cad files I will sell for 1500 NOK.

Also I would need a written statement that you will not share the files, and a copy of id card (social security number blacked out).

Don´t like to ask for these things of course, but may help keeping some control over the files.



Let me know if this is okay by you, and have a beautiful day.



Kind regards,



Ronny Buarøy"



Thought some of you maybe interested. 



NOK = Norwegian Krone = 0.12 US Dollars

Hey RifleGuy, you are very witty/funny. Good for the forum. Cheers.

---

Posted on **2017-03-08 05:46:03** by **TomTheWhittler**:

So $ 180.00 USD and we as a group could still not share.

Still there would be nothing stopping anyone here creating their own version in some Cad format and sharing.

---

Posted on **2017-03-08 05:57:11** by **TomTheWhittler**:

I'm not against the guy trying to make a living so part of me is torn about what is ethical/moral. 

Still if he had not shown the picture of all the pieces then it would be harder to do and we would have to be more creative.. The key is that first picture of all the pieces. The bracket is a standard bracket so you could use that to scale the rest. It might be easier to make a night light scale version first to get the bugs out. It would waste a lot less wood.

It looks to me like all his hardware is Ikea stuff. In fact I may have at least one of those hanging pendants around the house. Whatever the case, he's entitled to do what he likes with his design. I'm impressed he's willing to share at all, to be honest... it's so easy to share digital files he's really taking a big risk.

---

Posted on **2017-03-08 06:28:04** by **TomTheWhittler**:

It is that "written statement that you will not share the files" and "a copy of id card (social security number blacked out)" that gets me. 

With identity theft and all I am not willing to go that path.

The $ 180.00 is borderline "worth it" cost for my time and energy.

If it was $ 75.00 without all that other stuff I would go for it just to save me the hassle of trying to create the drawings.

---

Posted on **2017-03-08 10:15:45** by **spatialguy**:

My thoughts were in line with TRS on this, in that I was quite surprised/impressed that he was remotely interested in sharing his files at all. I expected a reply saying either I "could buy the completed product at acme.com" or "sorry, no can do". Regards the price, it all depends how much you like the product, your skill set, and how much value you put on your own time. I personally thought the price was cheap considering that it would take me 30seconds to post on the web and make that design and his IP over it forever worthless. 

I'm not going to buy it at the moment, a bit premature I think given my situation lol.

Here is one where you can download the STL files.

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2089166

Oops wait. we already did that one at the top of this discussion.

---

Posted on **2017-03-08 10:58:06** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

Oooh that's nice! I'd probably re-work it to get that ring at the top hidden underneath, but it's a great starting point. What's an STL file?

---

Posted on **2017-03-08 11:00:37** by **TomTheWhittler**:

depends on what you use for cad. Sketchup has a converter.

Posted on **2017-03-08 11:02:22** by **lthomas987**:

STL stands for stereolithography most commonly used in additive manufacturing. (like 3d printing)

---

Posted on **2017-03-08 11:10:52** by **lthomas987**:

So I went and looked and there is a dxf for that lamp as well as STLs.

---

Posted on **2017-03-08 14:59:58** by **spatialguy**:

Wow, the pinecone light is spectacular. Did you notice it's been laser cut (router will work too I reckon) and every one of the 273 parts has his logo laser etched onto it. It's a classy piece of work! 

STL is the standard file type that you feed to a 3D Printer (like ithomas987 post)

---

Posted on **2017-03-08 15:20:58** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

We just got a small Universal Laser Systems 30 watt unit at work... can't wait to play with it. Between production runs of course. ;)

---

Posted on **2017-03-08 15:26:01** by **spatialguy**:

I've been wanting one to play with too. Is your work one for engraving/etching things?

@spatialguy we'll do a limited amount of cutting (paper/thin plastics) but otherwise yes, we're just etching polycarbonate.

---

Posted on **2017-03-09 05:32:41** by **TomTheWhittler**:

There are a lot of DXF files for sale for various lamps in etsy

Posted on **2017-03-09 06:01:38** by **thomasgkristensen**:

@spatialguy: Thanks! He also sent me this link today: https://www.etsy.com/no-en/shop/ScandinavianLights (I think it might be the same as yours but it's broken). I'm considering trying one of the cheaper designs to gain some confidence with the process.



Thanks everyone for your interest! I'm much closer to finding a lamp I like now :-D

---

Posted on **2017-03-10 06:57:29** by **nathanmiller**:

that is beautiful! definitely need to make one of these in May. :D

And I had never thought of looking for design files on Etsy. What an interesting idea!

---

Posted on **2017-03-10 07:13:40** by **TomTheWhittler**:

nathanmiller, Searching for "DXF files" on Etsy shows a ton of files for very reasonable cost each. That would be a way to get a jump on a design is to get on of these and modify to your liking.

---

Posted on **2017-03-10 07:20:51** by **thomasgkristensen**:

I had no idea etsy would be such a good source for designs! Good shout.

---

Posted on **2017-03-10 10:15:06** by **spatialguy**:

No worries...I will post other sources as I find them.
