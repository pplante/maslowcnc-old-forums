Designed for drag use... you don't turn on the spindle/router.

I wonder how that would work out  without any kind of spring pressure... Maybe a secondary Z axis like the part labeling add-on someone suggested? You could work out your own spring pressure in that scenario.

put the bit in a ball point pen and use that spring. Yes some sort of spring is necessary, and easily made.
