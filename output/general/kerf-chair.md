Here is an interesting chair design, with free download of the design.  There are also other furniture files available on the web site.

You can use epoxy to fill the cut outs for really nice effects. Imagine bright white high gloss or black or alternatingâ€¦I purchased a Triton workcentre 13 years ago and one of the instruction VHS tapes showed Kerfing and all of a sudden many kerfed items appeared in my shed including a round mirror with rabbiting done prior to kerfing. It's good fun, give it a go!

spatialguy, I read your above post in a different subject area which did not make sense to the topic. In fact I was thinking you were a little off ;) Now that you have moved it to the correct subject area and as the correct response it makes perfect sense. Good idea.

I deleted it. I'm here daily cleaning ups stuff like that, moving posts to the appropriate channels, etc. If you need something like that taken care of that's not obvious, drop me or Hannah a PM and we'll take care of it.

Are you the forum moderator rifles? I was thinking you were Tom, of the Bar, Hannah, Tom clan. No?&quest;

Nope, not Tom. Just a forum moderator who has experience with start-ups, a passion for DIY and zero ego to bruise. :)

Ahh.. The Rabbit of Caerbannog strikes again. ;) lol

I am glad someone is fixing things so there is some flow control.

I am a "Tom" but not "The Tom" of Bar, Hannah, and Tom.

Just a wood working guy that just Whittles away and actually owns a Kickstarter WhittlerCNC machine.

Tom, that looks pretty cool. I like the 'no bottom' effect. That machine could be -portable- and -clamped- to any surface and mill it. Fireplace mantles, headboards and tables otherwise too big to move conveniently.

The web page mentions phenolic, which in my mind means a bakelite type material.

Do you know what the exact trade name of the frame material is?

That is the one : The Kickstarter was here :

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/464808174/whittlecnc-high-quality-affordable-small-footprint

In the Kickstarter it was wrote : "The frame is made of 1/2" Phenolic which is extremely strong and durable. It's the same material that is used for bowling lanes.".

It was okay to learn from and got me into CNC but I would not recommend it. Almost everyone got their machine but then the creator (Zachary)  just disappeared for the last 10 months. The forum turned negative as peoples machines broke down and there was no support. All the parts were made from 3-D printed material and would not hold up. Just recently Zachary appears to have returned then erased the entire forum so there is no evidence of the problems. I replaced the controller that came with it (never could get it to work) with a Raspberry Pi 3 and a Protoneer CnChat. That worked great. A couple 3-D printed parts broke and I started to rebuild in metal. I then decided  if I was going to go to that trouble I would build a bigger better machine to actually hold a real r outer as the WhittleCnc had a Dremel clone and a whip shaft tool holder that would fail. Then MaslowCnC came along and I thought that would be easier. The MaslowCNC even has a active forum with positive users even before the product ships. I am so looking forward to the MaslowCnc.

For a "no bottom effect" I think this (handibot)  is the one to get.

But at $ 2,895.00 it is a little tough to swallow.
