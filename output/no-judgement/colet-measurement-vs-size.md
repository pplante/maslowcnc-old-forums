## Colet measurement vs. Size of z-axis shaft
Posted on *2017-02-28 10:23:38* by *hannahteagle*

Just a quick note about a common question I've received - when looking through router specs online or elsewhere, the company will almost always list the size of the colet. To clarify - this is not the size of the shaft that your z-axis motor will attach to! Many people have asked me if these are the same, but I wanted to clarify that they are not. The colet is the size of bit that the router will take, while the measurement of the shaft is a bolt that our z-axis motor will attach to. It is very rare that a router company will list the size of this shaft in their specs, as no one is *usually* attaching anything to it! (until now!)
