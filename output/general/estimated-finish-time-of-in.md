## Estimated finish time of instructions page
Posted on **2017-03-28 15:59:34** by **ledsled71**:

Any idea as to when the instructions for assembly will be finished?  I'm at the end of the published instructions, and don't really want to proceed without them

That is good feedback. I have been prioritizing things based on the order they are asked for and it has seemed like software fixes were the most requested thing. I will make finishing the instructions a priority and get them done ASAP!

Speaking of assembly, with all of the different frame design changes bubbling up on this forum, is it still safe to assume that the "official" frame and best results can be obtained with the latest designs in Github?  Also, was there ever any consensus as to the best way to build a temp sled to cut out the frame parts?

I would still go with the "official" frame. I don't know that there is a 100% vetted way to build the temp sled yet, but I had good luck making one using the printed PDF version. I will make step by step instructions for that method tomorrow as soon as I get the update done.

@tmaker it's never safe to assume the "official" frame will result in the "best results" :-) people wouldn't have other designs if they didn't think they were an improvement.

but the "official" design is going to be the way bar understands the most and will probably have the best support. It is probably also the one that the most people are going to be using.

all that said, the one under the topic "Modified Stand V2" is one I'm going to be watching very closely, it looks a little faster/easier to build and just as good as the fancy arms of the 'official' one.
