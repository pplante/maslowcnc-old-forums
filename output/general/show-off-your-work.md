I'd love to see what people have created with there Maslow.  If you've built something cool, can you please post a picture and a link to download the associated gcode?  



The Disney themed chair by blsteinhauer88 is outstanding.  Does  anyone know if this code is publicly available?

I was wondering something similar. Does anyone know of any websites that provide designs? I'm thinking something similar to Thingiverse (which is mostly 3D printing).

I feel like we've all gotten sucked into the hole of calibrating. I know I have.



This is a good prompt to get back into building things.
