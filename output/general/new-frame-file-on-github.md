## New frame file on Github

Hey Bar, I read last week's update re: your new, simpler frame design. I clicked the link in the email update and downloaded the folder from Github, but the machine.skp file is the old design. Do you have a link to download the new frame in Skp? I have a full wood shop and would love to build it/ test it today. Thanks!

He file you are looking for is New Machine Design here: https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/tree/Add-new-design-option . You aren't the first person to ask, so I think my link in the update was wrong. My apologies for the confusion. I will post an updated link in the update today.

Don't forget, GitHub is weird about downloading individual files, so for the best results download the whole folder using the green "Clone or download" button in the upper right corner.

I would absolutely love your feedback. I'm going to be writing up new instructions as soon as Maker Faire is over, so any advice you have can go into them to help everyone. The feedback I've gotten so far is to emphasize that the the joint between the motor mounting block and the 2x4 arms needs to be sturdy so use at least 6 screws there.

Happy Building!

Thanks for such a quick reply. The link works. I'll let you know how it goes. I'm most curious to learn what role the use of construciton lumber plays in the machine possibly not cutting accurately. I'll probably build the frame, work with it...then consider trying a version where I joint/mill the lumber and try and make it as flat and parallel as possible....if needed.

it seems pretty clear that the accuracy issues we are having are measurement/math/driver based, not construction accuracy based.

It sounds as if bar is making good progress on the measurement and driver problems, the math is hairy and hard to go though and validate, but if the results are good enough without re-doing it ...
