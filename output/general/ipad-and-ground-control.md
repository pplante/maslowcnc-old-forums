## iPad and Ground Control

Can an iPad run ground control, and if so, is there a different software download for it?

The iPad does not have a way to make the necessary serial connection to the Maslow. That said, one could use a VNC app in the iPad to operate the screen of a computer running GroundControl. One _really_ needs to be in the room with the Maslow though, so the added level of abstraction doesn't achieve much :)

Thanks for your quick reply.

I had hoped to use a RPi to run GroundControl and remote to it with VNC. Kivy has issues with remote screens on the RPi so that didn't work.

 I recently damaged my motor shield because I wasn't in the room when it tried to climb beyond the upper limits - wouldn't have happened if I had been present. Not for unattended use.

It's a bad ideal to run CNC machines without someone there
