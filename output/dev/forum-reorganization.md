Hi, all!



Just a quick note to set the expectation for posts in the Dev Channel; here in Dev the discussions will center around the current, ongoing development of the Maslow as it's intended to be delivered to backers. This would include Maslow itself and the pertinent software/hardware, the Z-axis and the auxiliary pins Bar has planned for users to implement various solutions.



The "Technical Details" Channel is for more "specs and tech" discussions where questions about the known features/specifications of Maslow as it currently stands should go.



Finally, the new "Modifications" Channel is for all the really cool stuff going on with the backers that want to modify their Maslow before it even ships ;)



If I've moved a post and you think its in the wrong Channel, drop me a private message and we'll talk it through!
