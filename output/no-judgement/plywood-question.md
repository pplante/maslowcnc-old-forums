## Plywood question
Posted on *2017-03-01 20:29:49* by *tntahan*

So I have been looking at plywood and wanted to ask you guys a few questions. There are a lot of different types out there, anyone have suggestions on what type will cut best for use with this? I read the post that said the stand should be made out of 3/4", and I am planning on cutting with 1/2 to 3/4" for most projects, and the only places I can find local that has them are the big box stores. They have 3/4" for around $50 a piece, does that seam high to anyone else? I am having trouble finding a lumber yard, anyone know any places in Arizona? (I'm in the Phoenix metro area in Gilbert if anyone knows anything in the area)

There are many different grades of plywood available.

the nicer plywood is more expensive.

the differences are in the quality of the wood used (do they use wood with knotholes in it), and what is the quality of the outside layers.

In addition, you can have different woods used. Do they use softwoods (like pine), or hardwood (like oak)

the ultimate plywood is "Baltic Birch", it has very consistent (and thick) inner layers, with no knots or knotholes in any layer. Finished properly, the layering becomes a feature, not something to hide. But it's very expensive.

$50/sheet is the high end from a big box store, Most of your work should be done with cheaper wood.

only use the really expensive stuff for the layers that show in finished furniture. for building the maslow itself, you can use the cheaper stuff at ~$30/sheet.

also find if there are other building supply stores or lumberyards within your range, the big box home stores are significantly more expensive.
 
If your projects are not going to get wet and will be painted/covered, MDF or particalboard may be reasonable (they are weaker than plywood, but cheaper)

I would expect cabinet-grade sanded 3/4" to be around $50 a sheet. You can look for BX (sanded) 3/4" which should be in the $30 range.

Thank you for the info. TheRiflesSpiral, what does BX stand for? I have seen that term used a few times

Plywood is graded based on the quality of each side A-D with X meaning "I don't care" (usually D)

Thanks for chiming in, David. "BX" is what you'll find at Menards/Lowes/Home Depot for their "good enough" plywood. The finished face is sanded and free from most defects and the opposite side is generally a train wreck. :D

You should be picky when picking up BX ply... if the sanded face isn't practically perfect, move on to the next sheet.

The X actually stands for temperary outdoor use.  Meaning the glue to hold the plys together can withstand being outside a short while while a house is being framed.  A means well sanded and nearly no voids and only small filled voids, b is larger filled voids, c is larger yet and unfilled voids, d is almlst unsanded and no filled voids.

For a back plate CDX would be ideal.  Should be 25-30 dollars and common.

CDX is an ASTM specification. The X in this context is only relevant when you're talking about sheeting. (Construction of buildings) For plywood (not sheeting materials) the X means something different.

I'm not saying CDX isn't a good choice, I'm just making a differentiation between the nomenclature describing sheeting materials vs plywood.

For instance, you wouldn't use BX plywood for sheeting because neither side uses moisture-resistant glues... the X refers to the finish quality of the back side. (Joyce standard, not ASTM) You also wouldn't use CDX sheeting to build a cabinet... the X refers to the moisture-resistant glue. (ASTM, not Joyce)

any chance someone with experience could put the plywood grading scale on Maslow's wiki? Seems like that would be great for reference.

The reference already exists. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plywood#Grades
