## Sketchup Models
Posted on **2017-03-28 15:57:59** by **tmaker**:

Hello - 

I downloaded the Machine.skp file from Github thinking that this was a Sketchup file but when I try to open it with Sketchup 2017 it just gives me a "This does not appear to be a SketchUp model!" error.  So my questions are 1) Is this a Sketchup file? and 2) If so, is there a special way that I should be loading this into Sketchup to view it?

BTW - I get the same error when trying to open Sled.skp.  Maybe I'm not downloading the file correctly.  I'm basically just right clicking on the link and selecting "Save link As" in Chrome running on OSX.  Is there a different way to download the file?

Yep, those are sketchup models... I would re-install Sketchup if I were you.

All of my other Sketchup files load fine so my guess is that I'm not downloading them correctly?&quest;

Oh! Well that is odd... I'm not at home or I would download them and try them myself.

Ah it looks like the right-click method doesn't work.  If I download the entire Mechanics master branch as a zip file, extract the zip, then open the files from there, it works as expected. 

However, I do get this version warning message as I assume that I'm running a newer version of Sketchup: "This model was last saved in version 16.1.1449. If you save it with the current version you will no longer be able to load it in the previous version."

Looks like I should update my sketchup

A new version of Sketchup can save to many of the older formats. Let's save in one of the older formats so folks won't be required to have the latest release?
