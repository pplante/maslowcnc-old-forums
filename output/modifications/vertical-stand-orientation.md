## vertical stand orientation
Posted on *2017-05-26 10:20:37* by *squareaffair*

I am curious if anyone has attempted a vertical base stand orientation, with the plywood 4' wide and standing 8' tall. I want to know if there would be any immediate issues with a set up like this. I am considering ordering the maslow, but also trying to plan where i would set it up in my studio (i have plenty of ceiling height)

There is at least one other person working on doing this. It should work, but you probably save a bit less space than you expect. The closer the chains are to vertical, the less force you have from gravity to move the router as you need to.

grab the python file http://lang.hm/maslow/v-plotter.py and play around with it to get an idea of the dimensions you would want to end up going with to have a chance of getting the full cutting area.
