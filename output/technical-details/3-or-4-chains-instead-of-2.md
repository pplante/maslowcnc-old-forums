## 3 or 4 chains instead of 2?

Then you could tension the system, remove the bricks, and perhaps get better results.  Initially I was thinking 4, but then realized 3 is probably more optimal.  Seems like a nice community add if it's possible to buy an extra motor.

If I wasn't so busy I'd be all over it.  I'll have to see how much I use this before committing time to implementing something like this.

Was something like this ever experimented with during early testing?

That was my first thought too :-)

I played around with a 4 chain system using counter weights to tension the second two chains instead of motors. It worked well, but I decided that the added complexity wasn't worth it. 

If it becomes something you want to pursue, I'm happy to swap notes. You can see a quick overview of my process here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK-6OKtVRfw
