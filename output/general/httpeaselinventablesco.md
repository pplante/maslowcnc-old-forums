Has anyone tried this if so what settings did you plug in?

Yes, I just use birchwood, and select your bit, manually set feed rate and depth of cut,  with 1/8th inch bit, I usually use 80 Ipm and 0.20 step. I also tell it I'm using .80 wood to get all the way through. It will generate an .nc file. Less temperamental than makercam, but sometimes confusing to assign the right cut like center, inside, or outside.  Play with it though I use it frequently when makercam won't load a file correctly  👍🏻
