## Recalibrate position

Is there an easy way to recalibrate the position after it gets out of sync after, say, a dozen or so communcation timeouts? ;-)

This is a prime candidate for a new Wiki Page

One way I can think of is to mark the chain link that is on the 12 o'clock on the sprockets after they are calibrated once. Then you hook them in the same position and use >Actions>Advanced>Calibrate chain length manual.

@gero - That was my first idea and I'm kicking myself for not having done it before.  But then I thought that it's just out of sync with the current, actual position.  If I could skip to the step of tightening the chain in the wizard, I would THINK that I'd be able to get it back in sync.

@laufu - you can skip that step, or any step in the wizard. Skipping a step leaves the previously recorded data value for that step unchanged. 
 You could instead use the ‘Actions/Calibrate Chain Length’ button which runs out the left motor chain first then the right. When using that, I usually use the auto calibration Step1 to get a sprocket tooth on each motor to 12 o’clock and then skip out of the rest of the auto steps. When extending the chains, watch out that the tag end of the chain doesn't over-wrap. Especially the right motor, which starts running immediately when the left one stops - gotta pay attention at least until that’s done! Having these chain links marked has saved me much time when experimenting.

I think Actions -> Calibrate Chain Lengths Automatic might be just what you are looking for :-)

@laufu But why are you getting out of sync and a dozen or so communication timeouts? :-O

Yeah, @gero has a great point. That's the issue we need to solve.
