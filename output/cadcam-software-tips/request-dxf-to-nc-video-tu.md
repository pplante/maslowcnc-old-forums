## Request: DXF to NC Video Tutorial
Posted on **2017-03-28 16:16:36** by **carlosrivers**:

Hey I think it would be a great tutorial if we could have a video walk through of taking a DXF file and turning into G-code. I think a lot of people on this forum would greatly benefit from it. I've seen a maslow video, but there was some parts that still confused me.



There's a lot of great designs on this website, like this bed frame.

That's a great idea. We'll make a .DXF to nc video.

Hey really appreciate the video, it seems that the file I kept trying to open, "silver lining bed" is the problem for me maybe its too big of a file. I opened up the same file in the youtube video and it worked. So here's my next question, how do you scale these items to the predesigned size? I would think these DXF files are supposed to have all the measurements in place. Seems strange to me.

some dxf files have a lot of 'extra' stuff in them, and some are set to mm while others are set to inches. Sometimes they are set to mm, but don't have the flag set appropriately and so each mm gets converted to 1in when it's opened (with the expected interesting results)

Oh i see. That makes a lot of sense.
