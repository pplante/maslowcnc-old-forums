## Plunge router
Posted on **2016-10-18 01:00:34** by **larry357**:

Hi, awesome project! My question is: a fixed base router in new zealand costs a lot, would you be able to use a plunge router with this setup?

---

Posted on **2016-10-20 09:31:53** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

I don't want to speak for Bar but I think as long as the plunge router had a base with attachment holes and a safe/reliable locking mechanism (in the down position) it would be do-able.

---

Posted on **2016-10-20 09:54:59** by **Bar**:

Spot on. I haven't tested that, but I can't see any reason it wouldn't work. I chose a fixed base router because I wanted to be able to add a motor and move it up and down automatically, but if you are fine with doing it by hand, it should work.

---

Posted on **2016-10-20 11:23:39** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

Now that I think about it... a plunge router with the springs removed would make a good starting point for a Z axis.

---

Aaaand I just read about your plans for the Z axis using a plunge router! We're on the same wavelength man. ;)

@larry357 I'm in Wellington and shopping around for a suitable router. What did you end up going with?

---

Posted on **2017-01-15 00:01:11** by **mcginniwa**:

Also cool to see that there were 15 backers from NZ.

---

Posted on **2017-01-17 02:42:42** by **larry357**:

Still not sure, all I know is that my current one would kick up way to much dust. Unless maybe I cover it with a bucket or something. How about you?

---

Posted on **2017-01-17 11:56:28** by **mcginniwa**:

I'm concerned about dust as well. Looking around still. Pretty disappointed by selection. Going to do a field trip to http://www.powertoolcentres.co.nz/stores/lower-hutt-powertool-centre/ to see if I can get more options by talking to them in person.



I had hoped that AEG would have a version of the Ridgid R2200, but haven't found one.

---

Posted on **2017-01-18 05:31:22** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

It looks like they sell Bosch tools; they have quite a few models of router that are popular in the states. The 1617EVSPK-RT model in particular is one I have some familiarity with and appears to be available everywhere.

---

Posted on **2017-01-18 10:28:29** by **mcginniwa**:

Thanks for the lead, will check it out.

---

Posted on **2017-01-18 10:30:18** by **mcginniwa**:

Ah, that one. Yep, will see if anyplace has a price for it.

---

Posted on **2017-01-18 10:32:24** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

In the states you can find refurbished or on-sale units around the $200 USD mark. No clue what you Kiwis should expect.

---

Posted on **2017-01-31 18:04:07** by **larry357**:

Maybe we can get something like http://www.axminster.co.uk/bosch-gmf-1600-ce-router-1-2-950897

---

Posted on **2017-01-31 19:14:29** by **mcginniwa**:

Talked to Bosch NZ on the phone, they said GOF 1600 CE is local (AU/NZ) model: http://www.bosch-pt.com.au/au/en/professional/power-tools/c131483/p118300/routers/gof-1600-ce.html

---

Posted on **2017-01-31 19:25:33** by **mcginniwa**:

Called Power Tool Centre. They can order it, priced at $705 NZD, GST inclusive. Sounds like a product they aren't particularly familiar with, so when ordering double checking that it is right model and with both bases seems wise.

---

Posted on **2017-01-31 19:37:42** by **larry357**:

Just read the following at http://www.productreview.com.au/p/bosch-gof1600-ce.html :



 To save you some research on buying the fixed base:



The official fixed base for the GOF 1600CE (240V model) has the Bosch part number: 1600A001GJ. Unfortunately, I've yet to find any store that has this in stock... globally.



A little-known fact:



Unofficially, the fixed base for another Bosch router is actually entirely compatible with the GOF 1600 CE (240V Australian edition). I purchased the Bosch MR23 fixed base from Amazon and it works. However, it is a snug fit, and at first I didn't think it would fit at all.

---

Posted on **2017-01-31 19:45:35** by **larry357**:

http://www.powertoolshop.nz/product/bosch-router-gof-1600-ce/ is the cheapest at $639

---

Posted on **2017-01-31 22:01:28** by **Bar**:

$639? That's nuts. Are there any other rotary cutting tools available cheaply that I could try to support?

---

Posted on **2017-01-31 23:12:39** by **davidlang**:

@bar, given what we just found about the cutting power of the r2200, could you easily setup a trim router on there and see how deep you can cut with it?



Here in the US, the price difference isn't that much between a trim router with no good way to do a depth adjustment and the R2200 with it's nice depth adjustment and speed control. But if we see what a low-power router can do



this cheap 1/2H (400w) harbor freight trim router for $30 would make a good low-end to test http://www.harborfreight.com/14-in-24-amp-trim-router-61626.html



I wouldn't expect it to be able to cut a full 3/4" depth, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it do a 1/4" deep 1/4" dia cut without a problem

---

Posted on **2017-02-01 01:24:44** by **larry357**:

Maybe the dewalt trim router https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DWP611PK-Torque-Variable-Compact/dp/B0049ZFUK2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1485940801&sr=8-1&keywords=dewalt+trim+router is available here just not sure how the z axis would go...

---

Posted on **2017-02-01 02:25:22** by **davidlang**:

Larry, that's more expensive then the r2200 :-)



but my point was that before we start looking at any other specific routers, let's get an idea of how much power we need. 2-3HP is the max from a standard 110v  15A circuit and we know the r2200 @2HP has more power than we need. So let's look at the low end and find out what can be done with a small amount of power, and the $30, 1/2HP trim router is about as low as you go. Once we figure out what the lowest power we can get away with is, then finding routers to use above that power level can take place.

side note, it seems as if my last couple of posts have double-posted for some reason. I'm not sure why

---

Posted on **2017-02-01 02:35:53** by **larry357**:

Yes but the r2200 is not available for 230v :)

---

Posted on **2017-02-01 05:53:39** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

David, I've noticed that behavior when I leave the Maslow forums open for a while. I post, it shows twice, but if I refresh the page, it's only there once.

---

Posted on **2017-02-08 10:41:31** by **jamesbil**:

What about this? Triton router.  Https://www.iedepot.ie/wood_router/

---

Posted on **2017-02-08 20:23:15** by **davidlang**:

that looks like the depth adjustment turns a nut rather than a shaft, not ideal

---

Posted on **2017-02-09 03:22:16** by **jamesbil**:

If I'm reading the schematic found here correctly, the depth adjustment turns a screw thread inside the post. Question is would the z axis motor cope with the pressure need to turn against the plunge spring. Maybe @bar could comment? http://www.tritontools.com/en-GB/Product/Power%20Tools/Routers/JOF001

This is another option, on this router the depth adjustment turns a rack and pinion. Also the plunge spring can be removed.  http://www.tritontools.com/en-GB/Product/Power%20Tools/Routers/MOF001

---

Posted on **2017-02-09 09:09:48** by **davidlang**:

remember that any plunge router is not designed to be set to a depth by the adjustment, it's designed to sit at max height out of the wood, and then be plunged by the user down to the set stop (with a latch to hold it in place)



no plunge router is going to have a screw that will pull it down into the wood, that's not how they work.



yes, you can rig something up, but if you go that route, just look at the many designs for a router lift that are available.

---

Posted on **2017-02-09 14:03:44** by **jamesbil**:

The Triton one does have a fine adjustment screw that pulls it down. It is in the form of a threaded bar and rack and pinion setup. I have the 3.25 2400 watt version permanently mounted in a router table. It also comes with a handle that is inserted through the table top to wind the router up or down. The plunge spring is removed for this application. [Screenshot_2017-02-09-21-55-47](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:f6mJ:screenshot_20170209215547.png.jpg) 

I use it daily in my cabinet workshop and love it. Heavy beast tho at 7.5kg

Follow up for others in NZ out there (@larry357). Talked to Mitre 10 who in turn called Bosch NZ. The fixed base is not available here or in Australia. So yeah, have to order the US fixed base part (MRF01) separately from the US.



Did get a slightly better price on the GOF 1600 CE router of $558 (plunge base only).

---

Posted on **2017-03-18 17:09:27** by **mcginniwa**:

Another follow up for NZ crowd. I checked the price of ordering the AEG MF 1400 KE from the UK (https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Electronics-Photo/AEG-MF-1400-KE-Router/B0068IJ74I, only place I could actually find it available was Amazon UK) and using YouShop to get it shipped. Without NZ shipping and customs, but with exchange it was roughly $811 NZD! Ouch!



So I settled on buying the Bosch GOF 1600 CE locally (plunge base only) locally and buying the MFR01 fixed base part separately from Amazon US. The cost for the MFR01 including exchange and shipping was $150 NZD. Total for Bosch set up around $708 NZD. Should be less wait and less hassle with power adapter. Still, ouch!

---

Posted on **2017-03-19 14:15:20** by **larry357**:

about to order it, where did you get the $558 one from?

---

Posted on **2017-03-19 14:25:22** by **mcginniwa**:

Mitre 10 in Petone is ordering it for me.

---

Posted on **2017-03-20 03:40:15** by **roberta_aus**:

Hi  There, Are you able to post a link to the amazon site that posts the Bosch Fixed Base part outside of the usa? Thanks

---

Posted on **2017-03-20 15:00:30** by **mcginniwa**:

@roberta_aus, here ya go:



https://www.amazon.com/Bosch-MRF01-Router-Fixed-Routers/dp/B00AEBXH7S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1489880973&sr=8-1&keywords=bosch+fixed+base



Link worked for me for getting it shipped to NZ. It's US Amazon, but my account has my NZ credit card and shipping address and it offered to ship to NZ for $21 USD for standard shipping.

---

Posted on **2017-03-20 15:04:18** by **roberta_aus**:

Thanks @mcginniwa ! One more question : Do you know which shaft coupler size will fit this Bosch router for the Z-Axis Options?

---

Posted on **2017-03-20 15:20:56** by **mcginniwa**:

I don't, https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Tested-Routers-List says the "ease of attaching z-axis" is "tight", but I haven't seen info on which Z-Axis option to choose. 



The "More photos" has a measurement photo I think:



https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/More-Photos



Looks like 7mm shaft. I haven't following the Z-Axis stuff closely. Would be good if someone with more knowledge could jump in to answer.

---

Posted on **2017-03-21 19:02:07** by **larry357**:

was the $558.00 inc gst or plus? I went to Bunnings and they had it for $700 lol

Just ordered the fixed base as well from amazon. Heading to mitre10 tomorrow. I also wonder if https://www.tooltimeonline.co.nz/shop/power-tools/ken-240v1850w-router-3912bs/ is an plunge or fixed base... it is also available from aliexpress :)

---

Posted on **2017-03-21 19:28:54** by **mcginniwa**:

Good question... he didn't specify on the phone (which he really should have, legally). If it was exclusive, that probably brings it inline with the $639 you previously found. Waiting to hear back on when the order comes in. Will let you know.

---

Posted on **2017-03-21 19:29:40** by **mcginniwa**:

I wonder what Tooltime's return policy is. Could you buy it and see if it works and return if not?

---

Posted on **2017-03-26 15:15:25** by **larry357**:

O.k ordered the Bosch GOF 1600 CE - cost was $561-00 inc GST Trade price, I just used my local builders account and paid cash :) Might help someone else get it even cheaper :)

---

Posted on **2017-03-27 18:25:50** by **mcginniwa**:

Heads up NZers, my box has arrived in NZ. It's at Customs. I just paid the $125 GST and duties, so it should be released soon.

---

Posted on **2017-03-27 22:13:24** by **larry357**:

Good to know! :) did your fixed base arrive, mine should be here on 10 april according to Amazon...

---

Posted on **2017-03-27 22:18:32** by **mcginniwa**:

Fixed base hasn't arrived yet. April 5th for me.

---

Posted on **2017-03-30 18:51:46** by **mcginniwa**:

Yay! Fixed base arrived 6 days early from the US. Now just waiting on order for the GOF 1600 CE from local Mitre10. Might actually get to put things together this weekend...

---

Posted on **2017-03-31 13:19:04** by **larry357**:

Awesome! 😀

---

Posted on **2017-04-02 17:31:37** by **larry357**:

Picked up my router, and the fixed base came today! so will put it together tonight. z-axis size for the GOF 1600 CE is 8mm easy to unscrew and take of, with a tug. Think the weight is not as much as the plunge part. :) Be interesting on the space available for the whole z-axis system... Also would have thought it would have come with a guide as standard... so might purchase that for other work!

---

Posted on **2017-04-02 17:34:48** by **mcginniwa**:

Nice! Pics?



Once the GOF 1600 CE is definitely working with Maslow, we should update the section in the wiki about supported routers. There's a "untested" or the like in there now.

---

Posted on **2017-04-02 18:10:32** by **larry357**:

will post tonight if I have a chance :)

---

Posted on **2017-04-03 14:30:58** by **mcginniwa**:

Thanks for the pics @larry357! Yeah, will be interesting to see what the clearance is like towards the top of the z-axis unit vs the router.

---

Posted on **2017-04-03 15:53:59** by **larry357**:

Think the shaft coupler is 25mm diameter, so that should fit, but maybe the shaft of the motor needs to be extended not sure how that would work with the precision...

---

Posted on **2017-04-05 02:01:04** by **mcginniwa**:

My GOF 1600 CE came today. That thing is a beast! Putting the unit in the american fixed base gave me a little heart attack! Thought it wasn't actually compatible until I realized there was a third thing to engage to get it slide in. Whew!



Ok, now it's just power supply I'm waiting on. Might grab the part locally if I can find it.

---

Posted on **2017-04-05 02:49:13** by **larry357**:

Cool, did you get it for the 558 inc gst? Yeah a snug fit, think the fixed base makes it a lot lighter, also first time I put it together didn't realise that there are 3 heights to choose from (3notches in the router)

---

Posted on **2017-04-05 15:42:55** by **mcginniwa**:

557 including GST



I'm new to routers so lots to learn for me. Good to know about the 3 notches.
