I just received my new $99 ($150 shipped with accessories) Pinebook laptop.  https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=3707  After some effort I now have Ground Control running on it!

What things did you need to do to get it to run?

I had to play with it some.  I started off by following the linux install wiki but ran in to trouble on step 2 when it said to run the pip command.  I got the command not found error.  I googled until I found the commands to get pip installed.  I then found and ran the "pip install -r requirements_linux.txt command in the ground control folder.  This mostly worked.  The only error I received at this point was it couldn't find truefont or something like that.  I googled the command to install that then reran the pip install command above and everything worked.

Thatâ€™s good to hear. The Pinebook could be an economical controller for the Maslow.

Ubuntu has apt for a package manager. You can use apt-get install... from now on. Although pip is fine too.

I had to add my self to the 'Dialout' group. Perhaps the installation the Arduino IDE does that already,
