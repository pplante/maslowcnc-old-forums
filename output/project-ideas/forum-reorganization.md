Hello, all!

I'm going to be moving things around a bit... Bar has created a new Channel called "Modifications" where any discussion of changes to the Maslow itself should be posted. The open-source nature of this project is fostering some really interesting discussion and we want to keep it in one easy to find place!

This Channel: "Project Ideas" is intended to be a place to discuss things you can make with Maslow, rather than things you can do TO Maslow.

If you feel I've moved one of your posts erroneously, drop me a private message and we'll talk it through.
