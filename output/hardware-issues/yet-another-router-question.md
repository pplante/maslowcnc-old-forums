## Yet another router question
Posted on **2017-05-26 03:43:51** by **danychouinard**:

Hello from Canada!

Since the tested router list is so small, I guess we will have quit a few of those.

To complete an order, I have to actually choose the shaft cupler size.  Since I don't kno wich router I'll end up with, the decision is quit a wild guess.  That's bringup a few questions.

I understand that the router by itself is not that important.  I mean the thing will just follow the base.  For the Z-Axis we only have to fit the motor to the adjustment knob.  My current router - A Mastercraft Maximum ( http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/maximum-fixed-plunge-router-0546810p.html#srp ) seems quit fit for the job but I notice the the motor wobble when the base lock is not engaged - something that I thought was normal.  I suppose that the recommended Ridgid router is able to operate steadily witout the lock level engaged.  Can anyone confirm this ?

So since I might buy a new router, I might need a new coupler.  This is not excesively expensive ( https://www.al iexpress.com/category/146901/shaft-couplings.html?site=glo&tag= ) , but what I the provided motor shaft size ?

Thanks

the idea isn't to leave the latch open, it's to adjust the latch so that when it's closed, there is little movement. The Ridgid router requires adjustment to get into this state.

You might be saving me quit some money there.  Thank you.

David, you run your Ridgid with the clamp closed?   Are you getting smooth Z motion with it clamped?

I don't have one yet, but the trick is to adjust the screw under the latch to loosen it until you can move the router smoothly with latched with as little play as possible.

Bar has shown this on one of the early video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Kv3GZI6Og&t=33s

I have the Ridgid and run it with the latch closed. I wax the parts every so often, they slide smoothly when the latch tension is adjusted.

Good idea Scottsm.  I would beleive that the latch is fitted really loose.  I had planned to wax the thing too.  The gravity is really on our side for once ;)

I took the latch out of the equation and just tightened it with the nut rather than using the clamp.  Dry chain lube for bikes works as a great friction reducer.

One can polish the aluminum housing as well or use umhw tape

you really aren't moving the Z axis that much when doing 'typical maslow' type stuff (cutting panels). that sort of thing may matter if you were doing  a lot of 3d carving (topo map type stuff), but that's not really what the maslow is designed for.
