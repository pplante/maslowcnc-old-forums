## How do I start? (program, etc)
Posted on **2017-02-25 12:12:37** by **robertkni**:

Hey everyone.  I am new to all of this but will be a beta tester once the Maslow arrives.  I am trying to get a jumpstart on designing and learning software.  Is there a free or inexpensive CAD/CAM software to download?  Can anyone walk me through what steps i need to take in order to start cutting once I get Maslow?  Thank for your help.

There are lots of software packages available, a few weeks ago the weekly update included a link to a video that showed the full process from designing the part to cutting it.

Well, I downloaded a file from Opendesk.cc and they are all .dxf files but can only be opened with sketchup Pro.  I just can't drop $700 on that program.  What else can I use or is there a way to change the filetype?

The good old Google "dxf to svg" comes up with quite a few free converters, but I haven't personally tested any of them. I'm sure some work well, but feel free to give any a try and let us know how it goes!

For simple things I like this free online one: https://convertio.co/dxf-svg/



For more complicated things like parts from OpenDesk I like to use Q-CAD which is a free windows/linux/mac CAD program https://qcad.org/en/

It depends on how far you think you might go with CAD/CAM. If strictly 2D then there are a lot more options that I know little about.

Autodesk Autocad has been The Gold Standard for over 30 years. It also used to cost more than platinum. :) <-- Holy sht this silly software won't even print a colon-close parens smiley face. Duh. Whatever.

Their current incarnation Fusion360 is absolutely aaaawesome. The early -versions- were NOT good - buggy and featureless. :( (Nope won't print frown face either. Duh.) The bigger problem was there were no tutorials aimed at beginners, but at the time that wasn't their market so they didn't care. The early tutorials were all whizbang whoopdiedoo LOOK WHAT I CAN DO MOMMY!! examples of all the high end features. The problem with -that- was that if you didn't -start- and then -proceed- with a design the right way, along the right -path-, you ALWAYS later ended up in dead ends that forced you to literally start over again from scratch. :( :(

The current 'CAD-101' tutorials are excellent. UNfortunately they're buried in the other 500-700 (I fo rget what the number was) other tutorials at youtube. But the forums are excellent too, haven't been there in a while myself, so by now they should have sticky posts to point newbies (that's how we used to spell noob 30 years ago LOL!!) in the right direction.

It's basically free for anyone earning under $100K/year using their software. I CAN'T find a copy of the (legalese version) license EASILY so I grabbed a screencap of some popup 'info' text.

 [Autodesk-fusion360-license-01](/images/N3/By/N3By_autodeskfusion360license01.png.jpg) 

The point being that if you -think- you might go further with this don't bother with the Toyotas go straight for the Lambo and never look back.

No I am not a shill or employee of Autodesk. I never even saw or used Autocad except for a pirate version about 35 years ago. However I -did- use verry high end PCB CAD software (cost $7K 30 years ago) so I -know- what -goood- software is -supposed- to be like.

Autodesk Fusion 360. This type of software has been central to my job for 30 years. Don't use anything else for this type of work. It's free, training/tutorials are free and YouTube has thousands of them. The only competitor is Solidworks, very very good also but it will cost you $US3995 plus $US1995 per annum subscription fee for their most basic version. 

NOTE: The commercial version of Autodesk's Solidworks equavilent is a similar price. Autodesk let hobbyists, students etc use for Fusion 360 free but it is not-for-profit use only, else you buy.

Hannah, SketchUp is a handy program too, but you will feel really limited soon, plus you will continue to have interoperability issues with file types and the like. Why don't you jump into Fusion 360, your general experience with SketchUp will serve you well. YouTube will get you off to a flying start. Just a suggestion...

Hey Michael,



Thanks for the suggestion. I appreciate it! Could you link me to the mac download for 360? I'd love to give it a go.

I'll third fusion 360. I think the actually terms of use allows business use up to 100k before you need to pay so for most people it'll carry them a long way. It is a wonderful program to use coming from a 20 year CAD junkie. Simple with the power to go complex and easy to use.

Thanks for the "third" and the links - downloading it now!

while it's nice that autodesk is allowing free licenses for fusion 360, it's worth noting that they can change this at any time and/or change the restrictions. Autodesk is known for their predatory pricing/sales structure and file format lock-in, so the fact that they are making fusion360 free indicates that they are feeling the competition.



go ahead and use it if you want, but do so with your eyes wide open.

Posted on **2017-03-02 13:43:17** by **chauhuh**:

@davidlang I totally understand where you are coming from. But right now fusion 360 is the bees knees. And since you can export to the formats that you might need in another program there is no harm in using it while its free.

personally, I like it when opensource projects recommend other opensource projects :-)



But I did not respond initially to the recommendation of fusion 360, that's a personal choice for everyone to make. I only spoke up when I saw several other people jumping on with nobody raising any concerns about the software or the company, so I figured I should make a comment on the topic.

> @chauhuh

> Start here for tutorials.

Chahuh, I'm not ranting at -YOU- about this. You picked an intro vid that looked good and has a lot of solid information. But there are a few items that *WILL* send the newbie off in the wrong direction which is a verrry bad thing to do when starting off. -101 type vids *MUST* be solid in *EVERY* detail or a lot of people will -eventually- get verrry frustrated and lose interest or think the software simply sucks.

Wwwwrrrroooonnnnnggggggggg!!! That's where I was saying that if you do not start with the RIGHT WORKFLOW then something, somewhere, sometimes, WILL eventually screw up and fail.

That vid goes off the rails at exactly 2:00 where he says 'create a box.' WRONG!! I cannot emphasise this enough.

The first step is CREATE A NEW COMPONENT and ACTIVATE IT!!!!!!! I *CANNOT EMPHASISE THIS ENOUGH!!!* The -root- of the design is the design. Designs contain bodies and components. Components contain bodies (and components.) But the ROOT SHOULD NOT BE 'THE' COMPONENT, or except for the simplest designs eventually something sometime somewh ere WILL shoot itself in the foot without reaslising the other foot is already nailed to the floor.

That vid is wrong wrong wrong. Autodesk should realise by now that crap like that with WRONG WORKFLOW causes the largest number of user problems -later- in the design. Crap like that should be purely deleted and don't look back. I find it hard to believe that they did things like that in the first place. /RANT

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1Nx0kd-cJE This is a very good one. The -title- uses the phrase Rule #1. He mentions it several times. At 3:32 he emphasises it! A 'new' object SHOULD be a NEW COMPONENT!! Excellent. This vid will use a lot of words that newbies have never heard before. It's also a very complex assembly but pay no attention to that just listen to the words and pay attention to the -concepts-. Watch it about 4 times till, even if you don't completely -understand- all the words and what he's doing on the screen you'll at least be familiar with hearing, and thinking them.

The VERY LAST PHRASE he uses in the vid is ... guess what... 'Rule #1.' Excellent vid.

This one is a page not a vid. I'd seen it before but lost it glad I found it again. Which reminds me that second mistake that vid you mentioned was that he did not NAME the COMPONENT. (Didn't name the design either. Naming is crucial! When you get into the thrill and rush of a new design and of creating a bunch of components without naming you end up with a list of defaults.....

Component36

Component37

Component38

Component39

...which is of course illegible and you end up having to go back and rename them all anyway. You don't -lose- anything in the process but it's annoying.

Don't trust every vid. Many are wrong.

Hey guys, this is a no judgement page remember?&quest; There's no right or wrong answer to robertkni's question. I like Fusion 360 commercial software, davidlang prefers the ideals of open source software, Hannah was enjoying using SketchUp software etc, etc. Take a breath...they all do the same thing. robertkni, you won't go wrong with any of these suggestions, have a fish around on the WWW and see what sounds good to you and give it a go. Let us all know how you get on.

Thanks for bringing it home, @spatialguy.



Let's keep the rants to a minimum, folks.

Yes, thank you @spatialguy and @TheRiflesSpiral. While we appreciate everyone's opinions, we don't want to scare anyone away from the No Judgement channel! This is our safe place :) I appreciate everyone's feedback

TheRiflesSpiral, lol, I know this is off topic but what on earth is your little pic. Is that blood lol

:D No it's a bunny eating a cherry. My sister raised bunnies for 4H and we fed them cherries one time... it looked like a bloodbath! I found that pic on Google and it reminded me of simpler times.

I'll admit, every time I see TheRifelsSpiral's bunny pic I think of Monty Python and the rabbit with "sharp pointy teeth!"

Posted on **2017-03-04 18:01:16** by **spatialguy**:

And it was the Holy Hand Grenade that killed it in the movie after Sir Robyn soiled himself twice?&quest;. Rifle's pic is a classic ! Even better that it's real and not edited, lol

I'll throw my thoughts into the ring (and sorry for interrupting a good Monty Python tangent).  First, two more recommendations for CAD software: 1) OnShape, and 2) FreeCAD. 



Onshape is a young company founded by a group of the guys behind Solidworks. They have built an amazing amount of functionality in a very short amount of time. Because it is online, there is no software to install; it runs in your browser, much like Fusion 360. It's a commercial product with a free tier and a professional one. Like Fusion 360, there's no guarantee that they won't change the terms, so caveat emptor.



FreeCAD is an open source project based on the OpenSCAD libraries. It has a UI that is a little confusing to start with, but offers a fairly large tool set. The big drawback is that it is early in its development and that development is pretty slow.  I have had some issues where I tried to do something with it and found that a particular tool doesn't work that way, so I had to backtrack and try a different approach.  For basic work, though, it's solid.



I also wanted to make a comment b ecause something robertkni wrote might confuse some folks.  DXF files can be read by many different programs.  I think what robertkni was saying is that in the Sketchup line, only Sketchup Pro can read them.
