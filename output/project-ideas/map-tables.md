## Map Tables

This instructable has my spidey senses tingling... How cool would it be to custom-laminate a table surface with different colors at different depths then cut through the appropriate layers to reveal the blue layer for water, black for roads, green for state parks, etc... and mill a map into a table surface?

That would be amazing actually.  I've seen them done with paper in varying shades of blue as depth maps of lakes and such but to do it in multi color wow.  I think making and dying the plys would be a challenge though

*looks at his folder of GIS files*  Hmmm, I have a lot of interesting data I could play with.

Certainly on a 4' x 8' scale, that's quite challenging. My bandsaw will reliably re-saw an 1/8" from larger lumber at about 10" tall so I think that's where I would start. Basswood is easy to re-saw and easy to dye.

The challenge for me is that I don't have any kind of press and clamps just aren't going to cut it...

I think this may have to be a situation where I experiment at small scales then see what it costs to have custom ply manufactured. * shudder *

To be honest... if I was going to make something like this.  I would spend the money and get exotics in the colors I would need.  More natural colors in wood than people realize.

Wow, that's beautiful!  I'll cop to the "map nerd" label.

I'm pondering a version using Fuller's Dymaxion map. I'll need to try it out before I cut up my good stuff.

Neat! The Mercator projection needs to die a long overdue death. I wish the Dymaxion maps were more common in geography studies.
