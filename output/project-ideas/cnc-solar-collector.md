## CNC Solar Collector

A while back a friend and I built this project for his house. It took a lot of work to get everything put together even though the finished product is rather simple. The other day I realized Maslow has the potential of removing all the frustration! This is a working file, and I'm sure it'll need a lot of adjustment, but until I have a router in hand I don't know what tweaks it'll need. 



Here's the original project: http://www.builditsolar.com/Experimental/PEXColDHW/Overview.htm#Overview

That is very cool! I love the detail of his write up. Well thought out. 



I love the idea that because he is sharing his sketchup files we can all build off his design. I think it would be really cool to see this type of thing becoming something built into more houses.

After reading some posts arguing about different design software... yeah, I need to learn Fusion 360!!! Once I get a better handle on that software I'm going to try and rebuild this collector in Fusion. I should be able to get a lot more accuracy.
