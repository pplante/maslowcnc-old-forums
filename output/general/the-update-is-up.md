I've been doing a bad job of remembering to post the update here, mostly because the update is just a way for us to tell everyone outside the forums about all the fantastic things you guys accomplished in the last week so you already know everything in there.



If you want to read about how cool you are, here's the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1830738289/maslow-cnc-a-500-open-source-4-by-8-foot-cnc-machi/posts/1882147



Let me know about any questions!

If the plywood arms add very little strength, I think you should just eliminate them. I think that would let you cut all the remaining pieces out of a half sheet of plywood.

I will make it very clear in the instructions that you don't need them. They do make sure all the parts line up symmetrically on both sides, and I like the way they look so I'm going to keep them around as an option, but I agree a lot of people will probably eliminate them entirely and opt for an extra half sheet of plywood.

It's the "makers mark" I'm keeping them!
