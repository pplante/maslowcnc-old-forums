## One of the first things I want to build is this bike rack.

It's clearly designed to be cut from a single sheet of 4x8 plywood which is nice. [Desktop](../../images/tD/ot/tDot_desktop.png.jpg)  It shouldn't be too complicated to make with a CNC.

Right!? I emailed the creator to see if he would be ok with me making my own, but he hasn't emailed back. I also found this one: http://www.instructables.com/id/Bike-rack-of-wood/ which has plans you can download and cut but it's a little ugly. I think I'll design my own which is somewhere in between the two.

I like that it's free standing though... I bet you could combine the two concepts with little difficulty. :)
