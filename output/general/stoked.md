## Stoked!

I was so happy when I discovered the Maslow CNC yesterday morning. For years I've been ogling the various OpenDesk designs and WikiHouse projects, but every time I look for an affordable CNC router I discover that the existing ones are just too small for those kind of projects. 



What excites me most about Maslow is that it has the potential to make distributed manufacturing accessible to everyone, not only those who live in larger cities well-equipped fablabs and makerspaces. My local hackspace definitely does not have the resources to buy a large Shopbot CNC, but a Maslow CNC will be much easier to source funds for.



Best of luck with the Kickstarter!
