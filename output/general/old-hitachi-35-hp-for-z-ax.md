## Old Hitachi 3.5 hp for z-axis
Posted on **2017-05-08 20:09:51** by **benkelleriii**:

I am trying to figure out what to do on the z axis. I have an older plunge router but I am worried about the heavy duty return of spring in the Hitachi plunge router. Do you have any specs on what the motor will over come in the way of spring pressure.

in general plunge routers are not appropriate for use with the maslow as they don't have a screw that will move them up and down. They tend to have a screw to limit how far down they will go (and are heavily spring loaded to stay up, relying on the user's muscles to push them down), but there's not a good way to make it so that turning that screw will make the router move down.

If your router has that ability, then you would want to have the z-axis motor turn the thing that moves it up and down.

Not to discourage you (nor encourage you to purchase a new router) but a 3.5 HP spindle is overkill to quite a degree in this application...

That being said; what is the model number of your Hitachi? If we can find a parts manual maybe we can work out how to implement it.
