Please do not waste your time. New user or old user! Use Fusion 360 software!! See how easy it is for CNC Router use...or any other use...Laser Cutting, 3D Printing etc etc

Seriously, just use Fusion 360 and be done with it!!

there are many good options to use, some people are not going to want to support autodesk and be dependent on their goodwill

I'm three days in and just noticed that they store all of my data and designs.  That grates something fierce.  They control all the data.  They have all of your work.  I find it a bit creepy, but I get it for working with teams.  Still.   Is there really no way to turn it off and store versions locally?

I didn't like it at first either, but that's progress. Software has forever and always been 'in control' of data regardless of where it resides. M00t (and every other online chat service provider) has a copy of every post you write here. Your mobile phone service provider has a copy of every text you've sent. Yahoo Groups used to have a phrase in the TOS, 'we own your posts - it it Yahoo's -property-.' (Don't know if it still says that haven't been there in years.)

That said, there are distinct -advantages- to cloud 'online data.' First, when data gets damaged the engineering folks can see it much faster and easier, rather than emailing them copies of things. They can compare the effects of one user's operations to the same operations on different data, to see which / how it stubbed its toe.

Second, you can access your data from any PC that has the software installed, without dragging it around on a memory stick.

It's super-easy to publish (give others access to view designs) by naming an URL, again, without the annoyance of emailing large files around. With that, versio n updates happen instantly, again without emailing files around.

Lastly, when (not if) the user's hard drive crashes, they lose no data.

Yeah, I totally get it.  There are numerous advantages, it's just....new.  And.....I guess I'm paranoid.



  I'm glad I'm putting the time in though, and I'm really glad that you and others here have experience and can help along the way.  I ran my first simulations without red errors last night, and it is exciting!

Maaaaaaaaany ppl don't have the time!!! I'm doing this to cut foam sheet for model airplanes. In RC planes 'foamies' have faaaar and wiiiide surpassed traditional balsa/covering in popularity because it's 10-50x faster to build a plane. Build in one night and you're in the air tomorrow rather than weeks to months.

Same with Maslow -- getting off the ground with nothing more than a package that arrives in the mail, one trip to the big box, and a screwdriver, electric drill and hand saw. That's faaast!!!!

Sketchup and makercam make this fast and easy without a 2-year CAD training course. Fusion360 not quite so gentle on the learning curve slope.

So you've seen all the latest tutorial vids and you know which are +1 and which are not so much. How about starting a list of vids in the wiki that you think are best? That's what wiki is for, and newbies neeed the right tutorials.

@davidlang - come on David, an argument based on the goodwill of the supplier to keep updating/providing their software for free isn't one id expect to hear coming from an open source guy...you can argue that being open source it will never be charged for BUT you are at the mercy of the supporting community (Including yourself) for updates, new versions to suit new Windows/MAC/Android versions etc, competition with other Open Source software that appears etc. I just don't think it's a strong argument...goodwill and all...



Before you jump on me, I will explain that Autodesk has ALWAYS provided their software free to a segment of the market. Students mainly, not-for-profit orgs, hobby folk etc... The reason that they do this is so that when the students (and others) join the workforce, they may have a say in the software their company uses, naturally, after several years of study using Autodesk software, they will most likely choose Autodesk software.



Like I have said, it is part of their business model, a business model that has been in use more than 17 years, when I wa s last a student and used their software for free. Remember...It's only free until you want to use it commercially, which is why it's free in the first place.

@jbarchuk, If you are going to post, post accurately and about things which you know, REALLY KNOW about. The 2-year CAD training to use Fusion 3D - the kind of bullshit spread around to validate you own comments. In future, just write "I use and like Sketchup and Makercam"



If you feel the need to comment on Fusion 360, don't make a dick out of yourself, just add "...and I'm not sure about Fusion 360."



I'm pretty sure I haven't slagged Sketchup and MakerCam in saying how good Fusion 360 is. The reason I'm vocal about it is that I know you will not outgrow it or ask it to do things it is not capable of (yes they all have limits). I have not used MakerCam and only used Sketchup briefly. MY advice is: if you are new to CAD, use Fusion 360. Autodesk are the Microsoft or Apple of the CAD world. There are tutorials EVERYWHERE, including within the software itself - look there first. Tutorial moving too slow for you, check YouTube etc etc. If Autodesk suddenly changes t heir business model and you can't get Fusion 360 for free any longer, I guarantee I will refund you out of my own pocket.



Also, it appears your vowel keys are stiiiiickiiiiing ;)

Why on earth would I do that? Been using it for years. I wrote about two topics, that cloud data isn't such a bad thing, that for non-nerds the sketchup/makercam combo works fast and easy. The average 'fifty-year experience home shop carpenter who has never plugged in anything more intense than a USB port' needs fast, easy and simple. He doesn't need the horsepower behind Fusion or learning curve in front of it. Not straight out of the blocks dealing with his first experience in electronics and software. If/when he does need the horsepower then it won't be a difficult transition because he already has some CAD experience. The way I touted it in another post was to say if you think you might need the extra features then by all means don't hesitate to go straight to Fusion.

The title of this thread is software choice. If there is to be no choice and you have no recourse for discussion other than personal insult, then I bid you adieu. Now. [click]

@spacialguy, if the developers of an opensource project loose interest, you can keep using the old version forever, or modify it yourself, or find someone else to do the work.



If a company looses interest in a 'free to use, but we own it, and we keep your designs in the cloud' software package loose interest, you not only cannot use the software any longer, but you may loose access to your past work as well.



It's fine for people to say they like any software, but as soon as you start saying that people are silly to consider anything else, you have crossed the line, no matter what software you are advocating.

"...or modify it yourself or find someone else to do the work." 

That is exactly my point! Be a software programmer or find a software programmer.

Cross the line?&quest;...maybe a little to emphasise a point. Fair call, there is plenty of really good software out there.

This is probably a silly question. I read that Fusion 360 is free to Hobby users, is that a correct statement? I do not see that option in the App store. I see it is free for 30 days, then has a monthly or yearly price. How do you keep it free?
