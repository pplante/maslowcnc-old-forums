## Can I run the software on a Samsung Tablet?
Posted on **2016-11-18 10:16:54** by **tmaker**:

Hello, 

Does anyone know if I can use a Samsung E tablet (http://www.samsung.com/in/consumer/mobile-devices/tablets/galaxy-tab-e/SM-T561NZWAINS) to run the software?  I already have one of these and I'd like to use it if possible as a dedicated interface to run Maslow.  Thanks,

Tommy

It's Python which has a lot of the same strengths as Perl, but it's a little different. The UI is done using the Kivy framework which lets you build for Android, so it's something I would like to support. The hardest part is getting the serial connection to play nice with the android OTG stuff. I haven't played around with that. 

Basically TheRiflesSpiral is right, you can do it but it would be a bit of a chore. If nobody else makes the software run on Android first, I will but it's toward the bottom of a long todo list.

Oops! Sorry about that! I had a tough string parsing issue at work the other day and used Perl so I had it on the brain. I'll strike that comment to avoid confusion elsewhere.
