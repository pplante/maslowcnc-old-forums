## Ground Control lost my home position... Why?
Posted on **2017-06-10 07:08:49** by **mikeberg**:

When I was cutting my sled the home position was on the bottom of the sheet my pc stucked in sleep mode. after close and reopen ground control I started the cut but my home position change for the center. so it  doesn't save it last setup it's normal?

Can't try to replicate that right now. But as far as I remember, for a 'normal' shutdown the position of sled and home is stored. If the sleep mode did not give GC the chance to store the positions that would explain. As soon as I have a running Maslow, I will try.
