## Delivery to the UK? ETA?

Hi, if one backs Marslow from the UK, would you be shipping for under $500? When can one expect delivery if ordered from the day it launches on Kickstarter?

Hey arigbs!

The machine will actually cost $350 and domestic shipping will be like $15 and shipping anywhere in the world will be like $70. We've been saying $500 because you still have to buy plywood and bricks. If you don't have a router and buy a pretty nice one, it ends up being around ~$500 by the time you cut your first thing out. If you already have a router or buy a cheaper one, you will come out under $500 even including shipping to the UK.

We are estimating that it will take four months to go from the end of the kickstarter (we won't even get the money for two weeks after the campaign ends) to shipping the kits out. We think we can do it faster than that, but we would rather be early than late ;-)

Thanks, that gives some clarity. One more thing, am I correct in assuming it's no more possible to order the Makeshift CNC? I understand that there's a materials list to guide DIY sourcing and assembly, but for someone who doesn't want to spend too long wondering where to get what, it might be nice to have one place to order all the parts.

We aren't selling Makesmith kits anymore, but you could probably build a modified version of it using Maslow ;-)

The hardware is pretty much all stuff that you can get from a local hardware store. When we were doing it we were buying things in bulk, so I don't have exact sources for the parts in small quantities. If you have any questions about a particular part I'm happy to help tho!

You are in the UK which might make it a little more complicated. Makesmith was designed using Imperial parts, Maslow is all metric. Is it hard to find things like 1/4-20 threaded rod there?

Now that I'm not sure about, just trying to get on the CNC train and I most definitely have a learning curve ahead of me, the difference between sourcing in the UK and sourcing in the US is part of why I was hoping I could order directly, but I might have to bite the bullet and give it a try, especially since Maslow won't be shipping for a while.

Well if you do, keep in touch. I'm always happy to help

Seems https://github.com/MakesmithAccessibleTech/CAD is being overwritten by https://github.com/MaslowCNC in preparation for the Maslow launch. Would have thought a separate Github repository would be created for Maslow, or is there a different place to access the Makeshift CAD files from?

I was torn on what the best way to handle the change over was. At first I was planning to make new repos, but the software is backwards compatible so wanted to keep continuity there. The way I decided to label things was as release versions, so you can find (and will always be able to find) the Makesmith CAD files here: https://github.com/MaslowCNC/CAD/releases
