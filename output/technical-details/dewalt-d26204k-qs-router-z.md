## Dewalt D26204K-QS router z-axis size?
Posted on **2017-02-08 22:47:55** by **thomasgkristensen**:

I haven't purchased my router for the kit yet but I'm planning on buying the dewalt D26204K-QS router. I was wondering if anyone in the community knows which z axis kit size to get for it?



Thanks!



Thomas

A few different kinds of searches at dewalt.com returns no hits for that part number. I also browsed the routers directly and don't see any numbers remotely like that.

Hmm, I think it might be a Danish ID for it. I went for a different router. Sorry!

Yeah I thought about that possibility much later. Different voltages/plugs/label languages might be different part numbers. I tried trimming numbers and letters off the ends of the ID but the site wouldn't return any 'partial match' hits either.
