## cnc cut furniture

My wife and I need to replace our furniture but the process frustrates me! Over priced, cheaply made wood boxes, covered in fabric - that's all furniture is! There has got to be a way to make one's own and not be too expensive. Have you seen Rome Reserve's CNC made, flat shipped furniture? See here: https://www.homereserve.com/
Here's a website with some people assembling the furniture: http://unschoolingparadise.com/best-rv-furniture-that-you-wont-be-able-to-live-without/
This is totally do-able assuming you know someone who can sew, or could buy sewn material that would fit an open source CNC plan for modular furniture. 

In my dreams I see a website dedicated to an opensource modular sofa system (something like this: http://www.houzz.com/photos/12528429/Brown-Beige-Chenille-Upholstered-Fabric-Modular-Sectional-Sofa-Living-Room-Set-traditional-sectional-sofas). You could download the CNC plans (for cutting into OSB), and sewing patterns. One could also buy pre-s ewn fabrics from the site (this makes the website/project sustainable). The modular sofa concept means the pieces could grow from a single chair to a really big sectional by simply printing pieces as needed!

Wow, I hadn't thought about making a couch but now I want to try...

I found a video that LoveSac created, demonstrating how modular furniture can create so many combinations. This should totally be open sourced for CNC creators!

LOL "...well-intentioned screening of Treasure of the Sierra Madre..." That guy is clever.

here's a video of how they attach the pieces (the video should start at 2m 30s): https://youtu.be/J2hWyR2OV4o?t=2m30s
Obviously it's not cool to steal a design or a patent. But this system would be an incredible inspiration for DIY sectional system (opensource, or course).

I love everything about that idea.
