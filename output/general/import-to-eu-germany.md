## Import to EU (Germany)
Posted on **2017-05-12 04:04:34** by **semmel&sauer**:

Hi there,



we are looking forward to order our very own Maslow next week but have a few concerns about importing it. Does anybody have experiences? How did you deal with taxes and customs? Do we have to pay taxes before shipping? How does this whole process of importing works? We are really clueless and hope somebody has some experiences or tips!

Thanks for your help!

In general, your customs officials will contact you to to collect any payments due. for something this small, odds are good they won't bother, but you never know.
