## Newbie z-axis question
Posted on *2017-02-10 04:27:50* by *thomasgkristensen*

I'm trying to source an appropriate router (in Denmark) so I can figure out which z-axis kit to order. It seems all the routers I've looked at so far have a spring mechanism which pushes the "active part" of the router up unless the lock is engaged. I can't figure out if this will work with the z-axis motor. I assume it won't? It seems the z-axis turns a knob to move the router bit down and up.

Does anyone know of any routers in Europe that has this action. I think some of Bosch's professional (blue) line routers might work but I can't fint the one Bar recommended on Danish sites. I thought the Dewalt D26204K might work but it doesn't seem to be adjusted by adjusting a knob, so probably not?

Sorry if there's some vital piece of information I've missed in an email. I've trawled the archives and I haven't come up with anything :-(
