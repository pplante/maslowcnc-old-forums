My new sled 18" 450mm diameter
And new facebook group
https://Facebook.com/groups/MaslowCNC
I don't really like Facebook groups  due to how hard it is to find all the information  but everyone seems to use them

I  used 450 mm bearings but there's really no reason to have them big
200 or 300 mm probably would've worked good and they're a lot cheaper at the smaller sizes

please not facebook!? we're going to have a new forum here, and i assume easily make a subsection/megathread and there is the [Wiki](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics) which soon should have a full functional 'Community Garden: Mods' section, meantime, make a page in /Mechanics, I'll move it when I'm able.

LOL no ones forcing you to join it's just another option

That is a gorgeous build! I can't wait to see it in action! I agree with @mrfugu that I'd rather try to make a home for the Lazy Susan community in our new forums

my point is that regardless of facebook, your experiences with a lazy susan option should be documented (should they work). please consider writing up a wiki page once you have enough information to present some concrete results.

Sorry didnt mean to step on any toes :)

Now that I think about it there's really no reason to make a second slab I can just bolt both arms in place and do a test using exact same sled fixed or freely rotating

We just don't want to miss out on any of the excitement :-)

This forums format really doesn't make it easy to have a dedicated home for something like that, so a facebook group makes sense. Hopefully by next week we'll have a new forum system and we'll get you a section! The issue is really my fault, but I'm working on it!

I'm interested in seeing the results of this, but refuse to create a facebook account.

Your sled should eliminate all of the problematic variables except the distance between the motors. I'm very anxious to see how it works. The steel plate is a great idea!

Steel plate is pretty cheap if you buy it in bulk, the prices at home depot and lowes for any kind of metal stock are 10x higher than if you buy them at a steel or aluminum supplier.

The sled I made is about 17 lbs + weight of router. I think the wood sled with bricks is also about 17 lbs.

Posted on **2017-07-16 18:31:41** by **rollandelliott**:

Is there an ideal diameter for the sled? 18' seems bigger than necessary and bearings that big are expensive too. What about a smaller 12" sled made out of 3/8" thick steel plate which would weigh around 13 lbs + a few pounds for bearings. Keeps the center of gravity lower, and smaller surface area keeps friction low, as well as cheaper bearing costs. And it can fit in a priority mail flat rate box, lol.

one component of friction is the pounds per square inch of force between the materials, a larger sled has less psi which reduces friction.

the other factor driving the size of the sled is how much of the surface below the sled you can cut away before it becomes a problem.

This is partially a matter of falling into the cut area and partially the fact that the cut area reduces the surface area in contact (and therefor increases the pressure per square inch)

Friction (and sled weight) is most noticeable in the bottom corners where one chain gets closes to vertical. The force of gravity pulling the other chain tight is the lowest here, and so if the friction is high enough, the sled will not move well when that far chain is let out.

This isn't an area that has had a lot of experimentation done on it, so play with different sizes/styles of sleds and let us know what you get in terms of results.

thanks for reply. I will try a 3/8" thick 12" round steel base next and report back.  With the lower center of gravity a higher slant might reduce friction as well.

Couldnâ€™t you get away with one bearing by fixing the router and one arm to the steel plate? The router would pivot but that shpuld only affect the vacuum hose, and might not matter much. Are you machining the plates, or having them fabricated?

---

Posted on **2017-07-16 19:52:04** by **davidlang**:

also, the bearing only needs to be large enough to fit around the router, it doesn't need to be near the edge of the sled.

I thought about using one bearing, but then one chain would have about 2 lbs of rotational inertia to overcome and the other chain would be overcoming about 22 lbs of inertia, might not make a difference but I didn't want to chance it.

Posted on **2017-07-16 20:07:12** by **rollandelliott**:

yes as mentioned above will be trying 12" bearings next and doing some tests
