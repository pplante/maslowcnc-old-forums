## Drag Knife?

Has anybody tried or thought about using a drag knife to cut vinyl or thin polystyrene?

Just buy $400 vinyl plotter
 You would have to tack the entire surface of the vinyl and have a spring loaded cutter in order it for have a chance at even potentially working

The smallest bump or looseness in the thin vinyl will cause a jam which results in a rip or defect

Maslow strikes me as a "rigid material only" kind of tool. Though I suppose you could pre-mount the vinyl and cut in-place provided the material underneath would tolerate the knife. Plus weeding could potentially be a chore since it's already mounted.

I second the "Just buy $400 vinyl plotter" specially if you aren't planning on doing serious volume. It will come with software and you can find kits that come with tools and materials for that price point. If you are looking for more volume up that to at least $600 and you will be golden.

But I wouldn't even attempt to cut vinyl with a Maslow unless you like trowing away money on vinyl. You'd be better off cutting it by hand.

the maslow can cut much larger things than the '$400 vinyl plotter'

drag knives are also great for cutting cardboard or 1/4" foam panels

Yeah but let's be honest a fully suspended not dragging on the material CNC and a Maslow are two completely things. I just don't see the Maslow working effectively in an environment where actually resting on the materiel has negative outcomes. Don't get me wrong cutting cardborad as long as you could anchor the cardboard sure. And that roller for scoring cardboard to fold. WOW. That's awesome and I could see that working with Z Axis, and how I could use that for shipping of anything. I could also see mounting a soldering iron with a long thin tip to cut foam. Maybe not how well the sliding on the material would go after a cut. Unless there was a way to trim any bubbly uppy edges as it cut. So yeah I can see some uses, but if he's wanting to do vinyl he's not going to beat a cheap cutter. I mean they can cut tiny letters. That i don't see the Maslow pulling off. Some even come complete with contour cutting now.  Which if you are forward thinking in your layout and creation you don't need, but if you are new to cutting vinyl will save you a bunch of heart ache, because you  didn't know when you needed to use it. Nothing sucks more than cutting a bunch of decals that you can't get out due to lack of a final contour cut.

The maslow is for cutting big things, not tiny things.

Use the right tool for the right job.

@andrewarmstrong Are there caveats to designing a toolpath for a drag knife? The only blade cutters I have experience with use a motor to guide the knife direction... I imagine an undriven knife presents some challenges? (I'm thinking of situations where the knife was driving left, is then picked up and dropped to cut right... how would the knife spin 180 without "drilling" in the corner?)

Just curious... it's a really neat idea I think has potential, particularly for things cut from foam core or very thin materials.

most drag knife situations have no motor on the knife, and so the tool planning the cut path needs to know the distance between the center of rotation and the point of the knife. It then plans accordingly and moves the center of the knife in an arc when cutting corners.

This video shows the way the paths get modified to make this work.

Thanks for that, David. It's interesting stuff.
