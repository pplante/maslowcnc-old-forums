## Dust Collector
Posted on *2016-12-06 08:00:38* by *lthomas987*

One of my first projects I think will be some sort of dust collection.  I am intrigued by this idea https://woodgears.ca/dust_collector/mini_2.html  where he's got smaller dust collectors for individual machines.  All the tools in my garage/shop are on wheels and get stored away in one corner when not in use.  On the up side I pull out the cars and get to arrange everything efficiently for each project.  On the down side it makes dust collection terrible, because permanent installations are not really possible.  And I don't have a shop vac for every tool  So mostly I end up wearing a respirator and not doing any dust collection.   What have you all been thinking about for dust collection?  I think it'd be possible to build one that fits behind the sacrificial board and the back of the frame.

In my small basement shop, I bought a cheap dust collector and put casters on it so I could move it to whatever tool I was using. It took some time and some futzing to get the hose connections all the same but it was worth it. It became second nature to just set up the tool, go get the dust collector and hook it up.

The empty space behind Maslow is a great spot for a dedicated dust collector, though. I think Matthias' solution is a good one for this application.

Might I suggest an easier setup?   [8$ dust collection](http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Woodshop-Pre-filter-aka-Cyclone-for-8/)

That might be simpler, it surely is.  You don't have to build the box, but once again my shopvac would be committed to that process.  If I build a separate unit that doesn't require it, I can use it on other tools at the same time.

Matthias seems to have an abundance of 110v motors just waiting for something to spin at high speeds... I suppose if all you're lacking is that thing to spin and have the means to make it, then why not? I can't seem to find motors (except buying new) so these projects always skirt the line of build it or buy it for nearly the same cost.

Yeah I suppose that I pulled a pair of blowers from a heater they were throwing out at work this fall makes the separate system seem appealing too.  Since I already have them laying around.  With the blower wheels and everything.

:D uh, yeah. That would do it.

Well I walked past them on the floor for a week wondering if they were going to re-install the radiatior with blowers near the entrance door.  Then they filled the holes.  That afternoon I saw it in one of the rolling trash bins, and into my backpack they went.  I a two axle motor and a single axle motor and a couple of the blower wheels. Sure they're like a billion years old and squeak.. but FREE!

Squeaky motors are easy to fix. New bushing or bearing will fix it right up. Maybe even some lubricant. Awesome find!

Gotta love dumpster diving.

Yeah I think it's probably the lubricant option.  Once they warm up they get quiet pretty quick.  Now I'm wondering about the motor in the upright vacuum cleaner I'm about to replace.  I wonder if that would make enough power for a little dust collector.

I tried that with a DirtDevil (an actual vacuum, not the little hand held things) and had limited success on my chop saw. I used to use it on my belt sander/jigsaw and it worked fairly well but volume is an issue... Nice velocity, though, so as long as you can really direct the chips into the catcher (rather than relying on the air movement to draw the chips in) it might work. Man, are they noisy though!

My best dumpster dive was for a mop bucket. I ripped the handle off and bent it so I could open the lock on my car...

Even cheaper. $2 buck check anyone?
