## Maslow Portrait Orientation
Posted on **2017-02-11 09:35:47** by **myschizobuddy**:

Can maslow work in portrait mode instead of landscape. I'm planning on buying more than 5 maslows and I'm going to run out of space in the landscape orientation of maslow.

they've said that the dimensions are configurable in the software. you would need longer chains, and will need to check the accuracy at the bottom of the sheet. But it will work.

Here's a page about v-plotter design that was mentioned elsewhere. The math is over my head. :( The visual charts at the bottom of the page make more sense to me. :) http://2e5.com/plotter/V/design/

When I first saw your post I was most concerned with having enough lateral force for the cutter to work effectively at the lowest corners. The chart says that it's doable.

The question is 'where in space' the rabbit ears need to mount the motors to fit a -given- work area. For example I've seen another mention 5'x5', and I intend to build 5'x3'.

There needs to be an equation for that. @Bar?&quest; I'll start a new thread in Modifications to ask the Q directly.

it looks like a portrait mode maslow would be about 6' wide 9' tall instead of about 10' wide 5' tall (and need longer chains)

I can't speak from experience (not having built a portrait version) but I would expect it to work. We're shipping with 11' chains which are extra long to give everyone some flexibility to play the design so you might be able to get away with the stock chains. 

Out of curiosity, what's the advantage of going vertical? Even less floor space used? Be careful loading and unloading plywood!

I think he's setting up that panel making shop. I personally would get one traditional machine and just cut 5 pieces at once though if it were me. However, I don't have enough experience to say whether or not the cuts through 5 pieces at once would be as accurate but it should be good enough for decorative panels. I suppose that this wouldn't work though if you were using a chamfered bit...

re: cutting multiple pieces at once, one problem is finding a long enough cutter, getting something with a cutting edge much longer than 1" becomes more difficult.

my estimate on the dimentions is based on playing around with the software I posted under the 'rabit ear' topic

a portrait mode doesn't need noticeably more length in the chains. and type 25 chain is easy to get and easy to extend.
