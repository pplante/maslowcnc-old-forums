## Type of chain.

I noticed in one of your videos where you tried various methods of movement (rope,wire,heavy chain, etc..) you finally settled on #25 chain. Will this be standard chain or stainless steel chain. The reason I asked was was that this may be setup in a garage with a more humid environment so that standard chain may rust. If the kickstarter one is just standard chain will it be an possible upgrade to Stainless ? Thanks, Tom

We are using standard chain but if you want to use stainless steel, that should be easy to do. I probably won't make it an official add on unless a lot of people want it, but you can easily buy stainless steel roller chain from any supplier. You will need two 11' lengths of chain. From a little shopping around, it seems like 304 stainless roller chain is pretty easy to find, but quite expensive.

You could always coat the chain in a rust inhibitor.  We use steel guard at work, I will just dip my chains to protect them.  Diesel fuel would work as well.

Wouldn't you be more  concerned about the humidity affecting the motors and controls?

Motors and controls are robust enough to handle fairly high humidity over a very long time. Raw metal on the other hand can rust and seize up in weeks in an exposed environment.  In a controlled environment, like a heated / cooled workshop, rust will be a small issue.  In my work area, I have no temperature control and rust is still a very minor issue.

Thanks Bar,. I can always use what comes with the Kickstarter and see how it holds up. Down the road I can change it to Stainless. I was mostly seeing if stainless was going to be an upgrade options as I would just skip the standard chain and throw some more money for stainless.  I doubt that I would dip in Steel guard or Diesel fuel as then the garage would reek of that afterwards. If the chain gets to that point of rust I would just go out and get Stainless Steel Chain.

Once dry, no oder or residual material.  I have some old cast tools that I found burried in my yard.   Got them cleaned and dipped them, they are on display inside.

look at what is used to protect bicycle chains. Silicon spray is pretty durable and dries without being sticky



graphite lubricant is also a good option
