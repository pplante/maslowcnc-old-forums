## Shaft Coupler Size?
Posted on **2017-05-30 09:37:51** by **skuba**:

Hey everyone.  I am having trouble selecting a coupler for the Z axis for my router.  The router is a Triton 1/2" Precision Router.  It can be found on Amazon here:

Would anyone be able to tell me which coupler I should choose?  Thanks in advance!

It looks similar to the MOF001. julian7 mentioned he has it in his router table. If he could take that flat knob in the back off, with one screw and measure?

Thanks for the response Gero, I guess I am confused as to what the coupler does and then in turn where I should measure on the router.

The coupler attaches the motor for moving the router up and down on the Z-axis. It attaches to the spindle that is normally used to manually fine tune the depth of your cutting bit. Finding a router can be a challenge, depending on where you live. I had to buy mine first, take the knob off and order the Z-Axis later. Perhaps it is worth searching for the router in woodworking forums and find a friendly guy who is willing to measure it.

Thanks Gero, so does the coupler attach to the chuck then? Would I be able to just open it up all the way and measure that?  I'm sorry, its still a bit unclear to me what I should be measuring...

The diameter of the shaft needs to be measured, from 0:29 to 0:58 in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU6u9legomk you see the movement.

Thanks!

On both routers it looks like you just need to take one screw off, the 2 pieces of the knob off and should be left with enough shaft to fix the coupler.

Oh, I forgot the WELCOME :-) Where are my manners... tzzzz

Much appreciated.  I'm excited to get this thing up and running when it arrives!

So without having to take it apart... I found their site and scrolling down it says that a 1/4" collet and a 1/2" collet originally came with the machine:

Given that, which do you recommend I select?

The collects are for the diameter of you cutting bits. The coupler attaches to router as in this picture  [IMAG0570](/images/pt/ptu8_imag0570.jpg.jpg)

Getting the knob off should be enough.

Sorry, I am a novice here. Thanks for the help.

So I got the knob off and all I see is a long spring

No worries, not long ago I was there as well. Thanks to the lovely people in this community, I have gained a little info.

Oh, you have the router? Can you post a pic?

The flat knob next to it. With the screw on top. Hope you get this one back together.

---

Posted on **2017-05-30 10:22:09** by **skuba**:

Got it back together and the other knob unscrewed.  The thing is, when I try to loosen the knob, it spins this funny little stopper at the other end.  I tried clamping and twisting but it doesn't seem to want to turn and untighten

Hm, strange, according to the parts list I posted it should just come off by pulling it upwards. It's the right knob though. The thing on the other end is to adjust the hight when the router is mounted upside down on a table.

Apparently I just wasn't giving it enough muscle.  Now I see this [IMG_20170530_112602](/images/ao/aonf_img_20170530_112602.jpg.jpg)

Posted on **2017-05-30 10:29:56** by **gero**:

Great! It's not round though. For the right coupler I would measure from the opposite edges. But will a round hole in the coupler tighten straight on that? Can't tell.

Posted on **2017-05-30 10:30:59** by **skuba**:

I'll upload a better pic

Posted on **2017-05-30 10:31:20** by **gero**:

I guess it will work. Worst case would be you need longer screws in the coupler.

Does that pic shed any light?

Thanks again for your patience with me!

Posted on **2017-05-30 10:33:25** by **gero**:

Looking at my coupler you should be able to mount it on the round part down. Looks long enough. That is the diameter you need.

---

Posted on **2017-05-30 10:37:46** by **skuba**:

Looks like 3/8" then!  Thank you so much for the help Gero! [IMG_20170530_113651](/images/j4/j4ot_img_20170530_113651.jpg.jpg)
