Has anyone thought of away to put an enclosure over the sled to reduce noise?

I had a router table years ago that I enclosed due to the noise. The router didn't last long... they generate a lot of heat and airflow is important.

Also, when cutting, a good portion of the noise is actually from the cutter itself. It would be difficult to attenuate that noise.

In my shop, the dust collection system  makes as much noise, or maybe more than the router. Hearing protection required anyway :)

I've used these earplugs for over 40 years.  I keep a pair in most of my left blue jean pockets so I've always got them.  We have a small farm, lots of noise sources.  Easy, cheap, effective.
