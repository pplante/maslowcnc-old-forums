Is there any other way to browse the forums in a more familiar format (old school)?

The Muut forum system is a combination forum/commenting system and that necessitates a different look and feel as compared to the xBB systems (which were really just bulletin board apps at the start)

It took me a bit to get used to it, but I actually prefer it now. I love that there are so few distractions; the format really focuses on the discussion.

If you're interested in doing some formatting in your posts, here's a guide: http://learn.muut.com/using-muut/user-guide#post-formatting

But as far as I'm aware, there's no way to view a Muut forum in an xBB format.

Alrighty thanks for the info. I feel like the old BB style is easier to be able to come into a conversation and get out whereas the MUTT format is better if you are always following the conversation. Well I'll give it a go and see if I can find a good mobile viewer.

Right... if you're "in" a conversation, the Muut format really flows well to me. It feels like people standing in a room talking. If you're coming into a conversation cold, though, the BB format does lend itself better to understanding that conversation.

Another aspect of Muut I like is that you don't see every single conversation that's ever occurred in a channel, only the most recent ones. That keeps the community focused in the moment and if a topic truly is important, it's going to float to the top just like a real topic in a room of conversations.

This is replicated in each topic itself... only the most recent replies are displayed under the original posting. Again, it focuses the user in the moment and favors a continuous flow rather than a dogged adherence to the hierarchy of a typical bulletin board format.

Can you tell I dig it? :)

Yea, I just worry about new people to the forum. Older, but still relevant information to design/build might get lost.
