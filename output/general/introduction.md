## Introduction

I'm Brian. I've arrived at the intersection of woodcraft, technology and simplicity and I couldn't be more excited about what I think I can accomplish with Maslow. I was trained as an illustrator and know vector graphics intimately. My profession is printing and hobbies include woodworking, electronics and home improvement.



I'm inspired by the open nature of this project and I'm fairly giddy about the Kickstarter campaign... that ticking clock taunts me!
