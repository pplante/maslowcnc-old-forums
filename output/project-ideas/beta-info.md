## Beta info...

Assuming beta availability will be limited, any (public) idea on the cost to get into that? I know how fast some of these things go sometimes and want to figure out where I want to apply my funds (is beta worth it to me), before things go live on Kickstarter and I'm sitting there waffling :-)



If that's not public, no biggie...

It's on the Kickstarter page:



"Pledge $550 or more - Maslow CNC Machine Kit (Beta Tester)



You get everything in the regular kit, and you get it FIRST. This is an open source project, we want to get you involved! If you are ready to help improve the design or just want to start cutting as soon as possible, this is the reward for you. You may receive two shipments as a Beta Tester, the first will be the complete kit, and the second would be any additional or changed hardware that would be shipped with the lower level kits. Limited quantity available."

I'm sorry... either I'm brain dead (quite possible) or just quick (nah, probably not). When I had looked at the Kickstarter, all I saw was the "sign up to be notified" - I'm going to assume the best and say the rest of the text wasn't there yet and they added it later :-)



(more probably I just missed it... sorry!)
