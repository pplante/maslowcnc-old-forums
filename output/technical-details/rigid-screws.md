I had a hard time finding the right screws for getting the sled connected to my Rigid router. I found some that work, but had to get them online, These work well: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008RNLM6S/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Thanks! Reminds me to order some to have spares on-hand and some that are longer for other sled designs.  Ridgid part number 660136003 from the parts list. https://cdn2.ridgid.com/resources/media?key=09f9c438-97f3-432b-b1f8-06304f469e11&languageCode=en&countryCode=US&type=document).

What's hard to find about it? Where are you?  That has to be one of the top-10 sizes anywhere. Lowes and Home Depot have them, and Ace I'm sure too though their web pages lists only a 100-count box.
I know you've ordered them already but here are a few bodging clues:
If all you can find is 1", cut off 1/4". 
Secret clue if you don't have a hacksaw... It takes finesse, but a hacksaw -frame- isn't necessary, just the -blade-. ;)
Secret-secret clue... For custom long or short sizes, keep some plain threaded rod and nuts on hand. Cut to length, screw threaded rod into part, attach another part, and put a nut on the exposed thread. Sure it's more work but beats waiting a week for a shipment. Hobbytown has threaded rod, (through maybe not #8/#10 and larger) and maybe has those screws. They're definitely more expensive than a Big Box source, but again in a pinch it avoids wait time.
If a screw head is ever too large diameter to fit a recess, file/grind it down smaller. 
Secret-secret-secret clue..... Whittle one out of a discarded automobile brake drum or leaf spring. ;) (Only  half-kidding.)
Not kidding on this one! -- NEVER EVER EVERRRRRRRR BUY WALMART HARDWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EVER NEVERRRRR!!!! It's the worst silly putty metal on the planet! NOBODY ever buys Walmart hardware -TWICE-. LOL!!!
