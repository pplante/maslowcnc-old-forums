## Right Angles
Posted on **2016-11-08 15:23:29** by **Bar**:

I've gotten a number of people asking to see a square, and I keep putting it off because there are so many more exciting things to cut, but it's a valid question so I should answer it. 



I cut a crutch last night (see today's kickstarter update) that was sent in my one of our backers, and it produced a scrap piece with a right angle in it, so without further ado here's a right angle in a carpenters square  [RightAngle](/images/3O/rb/3Orb_rightangle.jpg.jpg) .



As you can see it's nice and true. Maslow doesn't differentiate between the way it processes a line and a curve so the tolerances will be exactly the same when cutting a straight line, as when cutting a curve, but it's still nice to see it :-)
