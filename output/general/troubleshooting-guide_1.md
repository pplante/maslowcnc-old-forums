## Troubleshooting guide
Posted on **2017-07-03 11:36:35** by **ledsled71**:

At this stage in the game, would it make sense to start up a "lessons learned / troubleshooting guide" to capture all of the snags we've captured in one spot?



Could include motors running backwards, lack of motor response, chain jumping, z axis adjustments/tweaks, etc



The forum seems unmanageable for someone starting from scratch to capture everything we've learned

I completely agree. I even thought we had a wiki page for this at one point, does anyone else remember that or was it just something in my head?

There is [a wiki page](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide).

Maybe it needs to be more prominently linked to. I've added it to the wiki homepage.

Fantastic!  I guess we just need to populate it with some more info!

Yeah, i think it needs to be linked from one of the prominent pages on the website landing page
