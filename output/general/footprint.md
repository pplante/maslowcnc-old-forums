Any one know the total footprint when you work on a regular 4 x 8? I have little space.

Hi javierrubio, do mean actually on the floor? I have hinged the frame on the wall, so can take it out and back in. Alternatively you could make the back support 90 degree to the floor and save a bit maintaining the 15 degree tilt of the frame.

The machine is 10' wide and around 2' deep. As Gero mentioned, there are lots of space-saving ideas that drastically reduce this footprint when the machine is not in use.

Gero, have you posted photos of how you did that anywhere?  I'm imagining fence strap hinges on a stud in the garage wall and some sort of props at the bottom to hold it out at a slant when in use.
