## Maker Faire

I had the opportunity to meet both Bar and Hannah at the Bay Area Maker Faire yesterday.  All I can say it that my perception of them was exactly who I met.  They are kind, thoughtful and excited about Maslow,  

Every time I read the weekly update I thought to myself that Bar and Hannah must be genuinely nice.  Guess what, they are.  I had a wonderful conversation with both.  One thing I can't stress enough is Bar's request to receive feedback.  He stated how important this was.

I do know that both Bar and Hannah are very grateful to the forum members.  Aside from anyone who invested on helping this become a reality, of course.

It was certainly a pleasure meeting both of them and look forward to what I may contribute to this amazing project.
