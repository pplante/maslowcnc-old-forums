## Motor placement

@Bar in today's update you mention the exact dimensions between center of motors.  That it is mission critical. OK So how about giving the distance between inside edge of the motor mounts as well. I ask this because the screws for the mounts are not adjustable once the motors are mounted. It's late sorry if this does not make sense.

I measured 36mm from the center of sprocket to the inside edge of the motor mount. That should make the distance between the edges of the mounts 2906mm or 114-7/16in. Hope that helped

Yes thank you its very helpful. I was thinking of backers. getting the first time install correct. but I am gonna use your measurement this morning and see where I am at.

You're right, measuring between straight, static things like motor mounts is much easier than between the centers of shafts with sprockets on :)

While we're at it @Bar what is the optimal distance of the front of the motor mount from the frame base work area plane.

Thats a great point that it's easier to measure the distance between the motor mounts. Thanks everyone for calculating what that is.

 I believe that the optimal distance from the face of the motor mount to the work surface is determined by the goal of keeping the chain in plane the whole time so the optimal distance from the sprocket to the cutting surface would be the same distance as the distance from where the chains mount on the sled to the cutting surface.

Does that make sense?

It makes perfect sense. A very simple diagram... Down the road we will need to think about some adjustment for this 'height above' - what are the forces that need to be designed for and what can be ignored, what are the limits, etc.

Keeping the chain parallel to the cutting surface is the reason why I made the motor mounts adjustable. At one point I will attempt to cut 2 sheets and are still keeping that in mind. My U-profiles turned out to be insufficient due to the forces involved when moving to the top edge of the sheet. I was thinking of hinged at one point, but the further you go away from the base sheet, the more the math will go off. My next motor mounts will be each on 2 square steel tubes that can slide in and out the ear but I need to find a welder for that.
