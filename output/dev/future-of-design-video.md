## Future Of Design Video
Posted on **2016-11-11 20:36:04** by **Bar**:

Hey everyone!



I made a quick video talking about some of my ideas for the future of the design, and some of the awesome ideas you as the community have come up with. 



It's been less than 3 weeks and I can't tell you how awesome it is to see the community playing around with and improving my ideas already. I can't think of anything better than seeing other people get excited about something I'm excited about.



Anyway, you can check out the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbN-3Vz9TuI

Some awesome ideas!! I can't wait to see what this project turns into over time. 

I live about 10 minutes from 80/20 ( https://www.8020.net/ ) so if you want to test their aluminum rail system I could probably swing by and test out some ideas for you. Their stuff might work really well for a foldable frame and/or gantry system.

Great stuff Bar, thank you so much for taking the time to make these videos.  I enjoyed the router discussion as well.  



I really like the idea of the sled as the machine, I'm excited to see it implemented by the community.  It will open up a lot of possibilities, with regards to scale and materials and, well...everything.  Very cool.

This is an exciting idea. I like the possibility of storing it away as a unit.

Have you noticed any effects of electrical noise with the processor running so close to three or four powerful motors? Could the router and power supply plug into an outlet on the sled? I think I'll keep the control screen off the sled - don't want to chase the "pause" button! Is that connection USB2, with the 5 meter length limit?

I like the fold able Idea. You can also fold the machine into a smaller 4 X 4 foot machine,  for smaller projects, would require less space and be more portable. \________/  ->   \____/

Thanks guys! 



Electrical noise hasn't been an issue with the motors because I intentionally kept all the frequencies pretty low. The router and power supply could certainly share an outlet, mine share a power strip on the back of the machine right now without a problem. I use a 15ft (3M) USB cable without issue when I want to connect my laptop instead of the tablet, so I would bet that 5M would work as well. 



Chasing the pause button is a good point. The controller has some aux input/output ports for the community to use, I think supporting an external physical "pause" and "stop" button would be a cool use for those.



By far the most fun part of this is watching everyone come up with cool new ideas and pushing my ideas further. Thanks everyone!

I like the idea of moving the whole unit to the sled making it far easier to store however I'm left wondering how to deal with the chains, one possibility would be to have a "catch bucket" below each motor to catch any excess chain length as the sled moves around otherwise, while cutting your going to have chains dragging along the ground since we can't have spools for the reasons discussed in the forums regarding the ability to use a full sheet of plywood (mainly the change in diameter throws off the accuracy of the sled placement,) have any prototypes of this concept been tested? If so and they work I think that system would be a far superior production release.

Moving everything to the sled would also give enough weight to either reduce or even eliminate the need for the bricks.  Catch buckets will need to be there, at the far edges you will have a lot of excess chain.
