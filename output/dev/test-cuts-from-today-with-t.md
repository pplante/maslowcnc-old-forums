## Test cuts from today with tabs

I did some test cuts of holding pieces in place with tabs today while working on the software which I thought were kinda cool. Check em out:  [Cam](../../images/lu/dQ/ludQ_cam.png.jpg)  [Front](../../images/ww/ge/wwge_front.jpg.jpg)  [Back](../../images/97/Qs/97Qs_back.jpg.jpg)

THAT is cool! The tabs only stay on the last cut? Smart.

I really like the Tabs and that will be super helpful :) One question that the pictures bring up. It looks like the software does not like fully round tool paths. It seems to have a few flat spots that look like they translated to flat spots in the cuts.
