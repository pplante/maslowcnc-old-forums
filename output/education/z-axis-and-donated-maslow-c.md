## Z-Axis and Donated Maslow CNCs
Posted on **2017-02-08 16:37:07** by **jwolter0**:

One thing missing from the information about the Z-axis in the weekly update is what (if anything) Maslow plans to do with respect to the groups that will be receiving the donated Maslow CNCs.  Will you be donating the z-axis kit on a 1-for-10-sold basis like the CNC kits, or are we responsible for buying our own? We're cool with whatever you decide--we're grateful for your generosity already--but it would help if we know what we need to do if we want the z-axis.  Thanks!

Great question! You brought up something that we hadn't considered yet :) We've decided that we will donate 1 z-axis for every 10 that are sold, as you said. When it comes closer to shipment time in May, we will reach out to all the winners to ask whether or not they would like the z-axis. We are hoping to sell enough that we will be able to donate to every school, but we haven't reached that point just yet. Depending on how things play out, it shouldn't be an issue, but just in case we will most likely donate them on a first-to-respond basis.



Thanks for thinking of that!

You and your teams generosity is awesome!  How many Z-axis kits have been sold so far?

As of right now we've sold 245! So that works out to 24 donated z-axis kits. I feel fairly confident we will sell enough by May to donate one to every school who has been notified of receiving a free Maslow so far :)
