Hey everyone!

We promised in our update yesterday that we'd post in the forums when we received a tracking number from the arduino shield suppliers and we have officially received one! I just tracked them and they departed the facility in China just hours ago with an estimated delivery of Tuesday! Woohoo!

Now lets hope they all work. I had another Kickstarter I supported delay delivery as their very reliable China supplier sent them a batch of non-working Bluetooth modules.

That's very exciting! Please understand most all of us are patient but excited. We know there are plenty of pitfalls that are outside of your control and you're doing your best to work through them. 
Have fun with this Bar and Hannah - you've done some amazing work and it's about to payoff! Can you imagine what people will be making with your invention in just a matter of weeks?
