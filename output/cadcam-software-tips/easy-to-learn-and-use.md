What is the easiest to learn and use low-cost software to use with this machine.I have sketch up, and Inkscape now, alotI still ha lot of trouble with sketch-up, to me I can draw something 5X faster than with the program.I know just practice. but is this the easiest to learn and use?

I think that's largely going to depend on your existing knowledge... I had prior experience with graphics illustration software (Illustrator) and 2D drafting software (Autocad) so I found the transition from that 2D world to Sketchup to be very natural. Once I learned the navigation piece (and keyboard shortcuts) Sketchup has become very natural to me.



On the recommendation I received here regarding Fusion 360 I tried it out but found it a bit... I don't know... opaque? Sketchup took me about 10 minutes to grasp and a day to be proficient in the simple stuff. Without any kind of tutorials... just browsing the help files. On the other hand, I worked with F360 watching tutorials, etc for about 3 days and never really "got it". I'll have to take the time to learn it eventually but right now it's just too much of a time commitment. You should try it out, though... it may be more natural to you than it was to me.



If you're only working with 2D shapes, Sketchup is fin e. But if you want to see those shapes in 3D, you'll have to put the time in - regardless of which solution you choose.

I tried to tinker around with Sketchup in the past but it always seemed overwhelming so I never really got anywhere with it.  But last November I decided to take on a project building a new miter saw station and rolling workbenches in my garage and I thought it would be a good learning experience to learn to design in Sketchup prior to building anything. Once I had a real project in mind, I found Sketchup to be very easy to learn.  The tutorials on the Sketchup web site was enough to get me going and from there I just ran with it.  After that project, I really love working in Sketchup and am excited to use it with Maslow.  Here's the miter saw station and rolling workbenches that I'm referring to: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeuYaTlsMKRp1DA4GC9L3vK0q6Eh7s8cP

A tip if you're going to dive into Sketchup: get a mouse with a scroll wheel that is also a button. Navigating is soooo much easier.

for what it's worth, I have used Sketchup for a long time, since Google had their name on it. But I'm working to learn Fusion 360 because I can see myself doing a lot more with it. I agree Fusion feels kind of opaque, but if I can get past the learning curve I think the opportunity is much, much greater with it.

@nathanmiller, I'm also learning Fusion 360. The starter tutorials are pretty easy to follow, as is www.learningfusion360.com. I was able to design a standing desk that I want to cut as soon as I can build my Maslow CNC. After a few tutorials, I was able o design the whole thing, and build it virtually to make sure the parts fit. I used it to design the farmer's table my son and I built this spring break, and it turned out perfectly. Having no previous familiarity with other CAD software I think made it even easier to learn. BTW, I'm a 48YO amatur carpenter, who does software development for a living, so literally no artistic ability.

www.emachineshop.com is very easy for 2d flat shapes, however joining many parts is harder to do. If you remember your high school geometry joining can be done the old fashion way by calculations IMHO. it outputs to dxf, which I'm told can be converted to svg, but I've never tried.

It's not that F360 is opaque, it's that there are many tools, and many options per tool. There's almost never only one way to do something. It takes experience to decide which workflow would work -best- in a particular situation as regards efficiency, maintainability, and modifications.

@spyker I think you made a good point regarding prior experience. If you're starting from scratch it's probably as easy to learn one vs the other. I went through the process of simultaneously unlearning Corel Draw and learning Adobe Illustrator. Learning Photoshop, on the other hand, was much simpler because I had no photo editing experience at all.

I'm going through some video tutorials on Fusion, seems to be coming easier the more I play with what I learn, good solid program but it does not work the way I expect from my minimal CAD experience in the past.

This is probably a silly question.  I read that Fusion 360 is free to Hobby users, is that a correct statement?  I do not see that option in the App store.  I see it is free for 30 days, then  has a monthly or yearly price.  How do you keep it free?

This link covers it.

After the month it prompts you to either sign up as a commercial user or a hobby / startup user (free until I think revenue > $100,000)

you may also want to look at onshape, it's free version has no feature or revenue limits, the limit is that any designs you make are publicly available (although someone would have to search for them)



Personally, I dislike Autodesk due to their corporate attitude and history (among other things, lawsuits against customers to prohibit them selling software they no longer need), and the idea of having to send them corporate documents to prove that a business hasn't made too much money just isn't something I would willingly do.

They asked for no documents for what it's worth. I'll keep people posted if they do anything shady (in the future).

@davidlang Thanks for sharing OnShape. I'm a huge fan so far. OnShape is basically Solidworks but free and online, plus it runs on my computer which can't run Fusion which is nice. Great tip.

OnShape is really nice, especially considering how young it is.  The fact that it runs in a browser (no installation needed) and that multiple users can work simultaneously on the same file are really wonderful.  My biggest complaint is that they have only two tiers, a free tier and a $1200 per year professional tier.  There's nothing for the hobbyist or entrepreneur who would be willing to spend a little for some of the pro features.

---

Posted on **2017-05-13 10:41:35** by **Bar**:

I think we get all the pro features for free as long as the project is open source, right?

---

Posted on **2017-05-13 10:46:48** by **jwolter0**:

I know they have an educational account that provides the pro features.  The biggest pro feature is the ability to create private documents.  Free users can only create publicly viewable documents.  There are a few other pro features, such as increased granularity in document permissions, and billing features.

Got it. I kinda thought of the fact that it forces us to only create publicly viewable documents as a good thing because the community will get more fun stuff to build quicker

---

Posted on **2017-05-13 14:53:43** by **davidlang**:

the only 'pro feature' that onshape has is the ability to keep your designs secret from others. So there's not really much room for middle tiers.



There is no change in tools or other functions in the pro tier, just the visibility (permissions and billing only make sense if the documents aren't freely available)



onshape is not opensource, so it's free until the company goes out of business or changes their mind (same as fusion260)

---

Posted on **2017-05-14 13:56:47** by **jwolter0**:

Here's the list of features OnShape advertises for the Pro tier only (not the Educational tier):

   Custom Properties

   Centralized Billing

   Company Document Ownership

   Priority Support



While I agree there's not a lot to separate the pro from the free, there is room for a middle tier.  That middle tier is a limited number of private documents (for pro and educational, it's unlimited).  Originally the free account included 10 private documents, but OnShape took those away which caused quite the uproar in the community (imagine putting hours into a private document and then suddenly that document becomes read only).  



Don't get me wrong, what OnShape offers to free accounts is still really good.  And I agree with Bar that for an open-source community like Maslow, the public-documents-only nature of free accounts is a great fit. I'm just saying that given OnShape's business model which is based on user subscriptions, they're missing an opportunity by not having a middle tier.

what do they mean by 'custom properties'? Is that metadata added to the file?
