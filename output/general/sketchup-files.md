## Sketchup files

Ok, trying to load the Maslow files and I am getting an error that it is not a Sketchup file.  Anyone else having any issues?

You might have the wrong version of Sketchup. They were made in 2016.

I do have 2016 installed.  Says not a valid sketchup model.  I might have a corrupted file maybe.

Try importing the files instead. Sketchup should give you a report about what's wrong with the files. The version that's currently in the repository has the same file date as the one I downloaded. (I was able to open/edit it in Sketchup Make 2016.)

Odd, same version.  Tried opening and importing and I get the same error that it is not a sketchup file.  Something has to be in my download.  *off to try some more things*

Ok, I got valid files to download and load up properly.  Now to work out a design that might work for the z axis idea I have.
