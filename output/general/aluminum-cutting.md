Has anyone experimented with cutting aluminum plate on this? I am wondering if this could handle it.

Look at the 1970 C10 restoration feed below.  He has photos of aluminum cut to make an engine compartment.

note that the cuts in the c10 discussion was about 7x deeper than what bar did for his tests.
