## Bosch RA1161 fixed base mod vids
Posted on **2017-04-12 14:28:31** by **jbarchuk**:

I created a MaslowCNC channel off my main youtube account.
I made -two- vids to demonstrate how to mod the Bosch RA1161 fixed base to add the z-axis motor coupler.
The first vid is very fast, 5 minutes including converting from coupler back to stock knob. So yeah the mod itself takes only 2 minutes. If you have some mechanical inclination it'll probably make sense.
If it doesn't make sense, and for the mechanically disinclined, the long version is 40 minutes long. It goes into every detail of what/why/how I could think of as regards tools and techniques.
I also spent somewhere between 5 and 10 total minutes talking about SAFETY topics. As I say in the vid nothing pains me more than advising someone how to do something, and they manage to hurt themselves when they try it. It's not hard to get hurt or break tools or parts.
Any questions or confusion please leave a comment and I'll probably add text to the vid to clear that up. I already had to add a piece of text to  say that the requirement for a bolt with a 1/2" nut is only to convert from the coupler back to the stock knob.

That looks FANTASTIC! I struggled getting the knob off the top of the shaft, your method looks very smooth. Thanks for sharing!

Thanks, glad it helped. Except for some sort of (expensive) gear puller I can't even think of any other way to remove the knob. Or maybe I could, something with rope and a tree to anchor things and a couple of mules. :)
I'm curious what other methods you tried? If they didn't work for you they still might give me ideas for ways to do other related things.

I first tried a sort of DIY gear puller approach using a C-clamp that didn't work at all. Then I tried a similar approach to yours, but by pulling the shaft rather than tapping it which worked, but wasn't as graceful as your approach. The real thing that tripped me up is I kept worrying that there was a catch I was missing somewhere or that the knob was glued on. I didn't want to break it.

I can't remember if I posted the link to this drawing. It is NOT clear that the axle and knob are not permanently connected, but they do have two different part numbers so likely that they're separable.

My concern was that the knob might be cast directly onto the axle. But that's a much more complicated manufacturing process so less likely.
The knob and axle are very nicely made. I've done the remove/replace thing about a dozen times and it's not getting sloppy or loose. It still takes about the same number and strength of hits to make things move. Eventually it will fail to stay held on but it'd take many more cycles for that to happen.

at least in the US, "expensive" ear pullers can be borrowed/rented from your local auto parts store for very little money.
