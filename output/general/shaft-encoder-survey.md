It may be a personal shortcoming, but when I click the link I get a "You need permission" response from Google Forms?

Bar, (Or Hannah... sorry not sure who wrote the form) Click "Send" then "Add Collaborators" and set the sharing settings under "Who has access" to "On - Anyone with the link"

That should sort it out.

Also wouldn't you want to know which router people use in the same survey?

I wish we had asked that. We'll send out a backer survey to get everyone's addresses before we ship and I'm going to ask that there. That would be good information.
