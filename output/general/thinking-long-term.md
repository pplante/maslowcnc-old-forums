## Thinking long term

Will it be possible to order spare motors and shields?  How difficult would it be to use an existing motor driver shield to run a maslow?

I've been thinking a lot about how to do spare parts. We need to make them available. I really don't want to become an online electronic parts seller, Id much rather focus on selling the whole kit so I'd really like to only sell parts to those of you who already have the whole machine.



You could easily use any motor controller sheild out there, but you would have to connect the four wires for the encoders to the right pins.



What are everyone's thoughts on how to go about making spare parts available without us getting swamped with orders from outside the community?

Just as a thought, could you talk to other online parts suppliers like SparkFun or Adafruit and see if they'd be interested in stocking and selling the parts?



If it's all open source anyhow, there's nothing really stopping them from doing it already (though technically this depends on what exact license is in use).



Obviously, you'd forgo the chance of making a slice off of each part sale but you'd also crucially forgo having to deal with all logistics.

That's a great point. If we could find someone else to handle the logistics side of things then we could focus on making the kit better which is the goal. Great suggestion, I will look into who can do that.

I just added a page to the wiki in response to rancher's "My Z Axis Struggles" thread, as a place to find vendors for replacement parts.  It might come in handy for this as well.
