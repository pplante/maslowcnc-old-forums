## Pegboard or holes
Posted on *2016-11-02 19:38:44* by *ppd655*

I was thinking about making using a pegboard to hold smaller pieces or maybe holes every so many square inches that I can use some wedges to keep the wood in place. Have you tried to use different sizes of wood on the POC yet or just sheets of plywood?

I did see other sizes are supported, but not how.  My plan was to just cut some 3 inch holes in the backing plywood for my clamps to fit through and make some marks on the backing plywood for alignment.  This way I can use the same clamp system I use for 4x8 sheets with smaller sheets.

Your idea of a few peg holes also seems reasonable.  I suspect there will be many pretty good ways to do this.

I've used a combination of clamping things near one of the edges or using wood screws to hold things in place when cutting smaller parts. I really like the idea of cutting some holes for clamps.

I haven't played around with pegboard but I like the idea. You could even just have the machine drill a hole ever x inches if you wanted instead of using real peg board (not that peg board is super expensive) :-)
