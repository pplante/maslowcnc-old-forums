## Z axis purchase

Whoops, never actually placed the order until today.  There was no comment field to tie the purchase to my Kickstarter ID.  How do you tie the add-on to the actual Maslow delivery?

Hey there. When we send out the backer survey we'll ask for your order number that was given to you when you purchased the z-axis to link the two. Just the opposite of what you were looking for!

That is a great idea though. I'm adding a form to get Kickstarter IDs from now on :)

The form is there, but what about shipping cost? I backed the kickstarter from the UK, but I hope I can get the Z-axis kit without a full additional shipping cost if it's going in the same box! Could there be a way to select that on your shop interface please? Maybe a special country?
