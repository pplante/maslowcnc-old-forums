## Shrinking the fram size.

I am interesting in building a Maslow that is 1/2 the scale. Would I still be able to use the supplied chains and such, or will they need to be shortened?

Since the middle area is the most accurate spot why dont u just use the exsisting frame design and load 4x4 sheets onto the frame?
To answer your question u woulnot have to shorten the chains but it would take all of 15 seconds with chain delinker at any bike store

Yes, you could still use the same chains, you would just have a lot of slack chain somewhere (you could also shorten them)

@rollandelliot The idea is to have a small footprint that does small work.

you would still be 6' wide

grab the python file http://lang.hm/maslow/v-plotter.py and play around with the dimentions there to find out what will work for the work area you are trying for.
