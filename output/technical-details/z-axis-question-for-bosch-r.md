## Z-Axis Question for Bosch Router
Posted on **2017-02-10 15:13:37** by **tntahan**:

I have a Bosch Router (1617EVS part of the 1617EVSPK kit). Long short, I am moving and it is in storage for a few months and i cant get to it, but I want to get my z-axis ordered. Anyone know what size coupler works with this? Also, I looked at pictures, any idea how to get off the fine adjustment knob so this coupler will fit on it? 

Deb, can you start a forum page that is just people listing what size couples work with what routers to get a list going to help out people like me?

I've played around with those in the store and it's a nice router. If I remember correctly there is a recessed screw on the top of the knob which threads into the top of the shaft. I don't know the size of shaft off the top of my head.

You don't need me to start a thread :p

I think you are right that having a central place to to keep track of that information is important. I'm going to look into setting up a wiki page on the website so we can list routers and information about them.

I actually ordered that router for my shop this week. (not for Maslow). When it shows up I'll measure it for you.

I have an RA1611 base for that router. The drive shaft is 0.250" and a nice chunk of hardened steel at that.

Here's a pic that shows a flat in the shaft and knob so maybe it's pressed on. With proper support for the other end of the knob a few taps might release it -- or explode the knob. LOL! That would be a point of no return and I'm not ready to do that yet. ;)

Also in that pic is a 1/2" hex shaped recess in the top of the knob. That's an optional drive port, but the plastic should wear out pretty quickly with any metal contacting it a lot. Maybe a hex plastic or even wood adapter would work in a pinch..

The drive has no backlash because it's retained to the frame with a curved spring metal e-clip. Nice piece there too. Don't lose it. ;)

What is the diameter if the coupler? On the Bosch GOF 2000 the shaft for Z-axis is close to the router housing.  [IMAG0304](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:lY6k:imag0304.jpg.jpg)

Here's a pic captured from a '360-deg view' at Lowes.com.

Above, I was WRONG about saying that 'the' diameter of the shaft was 1/4". I can't edit that wrong fact thanks to muut-policy. [sigh]

The notes in the pic, from bottom to top...

The shaft diameter at the lower end is unthreaded 0.25"

The threaded diameter is 0.375 3/8".

Eyeballing the gap with a caliper, the space from the shaft through-hole and the router is -max- 0.6" but that's extremely tight and doesn't take into account that above the adjustment knob the router overhangs the hole it's mounted in.

The knob has a slight taper and at the lowest edge is 1.125"

The red line sketched in says that the edge of the adjustment knob is outside the diameter of the router, but that's an eyeball guess. Next time I'm near Lowes I'll stop in and look closer at that angle.

The 1617 router (outer) and base sleeve (inner) diameter is 3.5". At the top of the router the 'outdented' max diameter is 4". That's 1/4 added in radius.

If we knew the diameter of the couplers that would tell if it would clear the router.

Or, since we know the Ridgid router works, if we knew the radius of the top of that router we'd know that the 1617 would also work.

So is there a verdict on which coupler size to order with the Bosch 1617EVS?

---

Posted on **2017-02-20 12:13:09** by **tntahan**:

Thank you for the all the info on everything, but I am still a little confused like petercoe. Anyone have a final verdict?

Posted on **2017-02-22 18:54:46** by **jbarchuk**:

I finally bit the bullet and decided that the only way to answer this Q was to try to detach the knob from the shaft. On the plus side it wasn't difficult. I mounted the shaft/knob assembly in a vice such that the shaft passed down between the jaws, and the bottom of the knob was evenly supported on the top of the jaws. It took a few pretty serious hammer hits on a pin punch to press the shaft out of the knob. There was no damage to either part and it looks like the knob could be pressed back on the shaft.
On the minus side the Q is still only 1/2 answered. The pic below shows some dimensions I took off the shaft.
On the plus side the largest diameter of the shaft is a nice 3/8" and about 0.8" long.
On the minus side that 3/8" portion -starts- about 0.7" from the -end- of the shaft.
The other 1/2 of the issue issue is whether the coupler is long enough to accept that 0.7" -and- still be able to grab the shaft.

Thank you for the info and the pics. I'll give it a shot on the 5/16" and hope it will work! I assume that should be enough room for it to bite properly

or we could have a page with STLs for different shaft coupler sizes so that we can print them ourself.

Here's another pic. The Q was whether a coupler would fit. I rigged up a few bits to show the space between the lead screw shaft and the router. Subtract 0.25" that the top of the router overhangs the bottom of the router. Subtract some clearance to taste.

looking at how that fits in the router, I would guess that a 3/8 coupler will fit, coupling to the largest portion of the shaft. it's a few thousanths smaller than what you measured, but that could be a measurement error and there is a little slop in the coupler

---

Posted on **2017-02-22 22:21:44** by **tntahan**:

If you look at the pictures in the Feb 1st update, they show a picture of the coupler I assume they will be sending out. It didn't look like it is big/long enough to reach down to the fatter part of the shaft based on the pic jbarchuk posted.

In the lead screw -01 pic I think the 0.315" is pretty accurate. Sometimes it reads 0.314 but that's within the accuracy of the caliper. To fit a 5/16" coupler the numbers make sense because the coupler has to clamp down on the shaft. I've never used a couple like that but it has to have some clamping range. 
The 0.5 -depth- of that segment is wrong, a typo. It's 0.15". Thanks to m00t policy it can't be deleted and replaced.
It's that diameter and depth that frightens me slightly. It's such a tiny area and it has to stay very tight. I think that'd be a good spot to hit with blue loctite. Clean all surfaces with alcohol first.
If this shaft weren't hardened it could be easily -cut- it so the coupler -could- reach the 3/8" segment! That would also couple closer to where the threads enter the router base so any slop would be less magnified. I'm not enough of a machinist to mess with it.
Spinning the shaft with my fingernail in the thread groove is very smooth. It's -not- just a modified chunk of random threaded rod. It's a very clean and solid piece of hardware.

If there's a post you want deleted, just ask an admin. Hannah, Bar or myself can delete a post after your edit/delete time is up.

Posted on **2017-03-01 00:19:16** by **jbarchuk**:

I'll edit the pic with the correct dimensions and either email it (if the contact software allows that) or post it somewhere that someone can remove/replace the image that's in error.

Posted on **2017-03-29 21:39:48** by **msmollin**:

Just reading through this post because I also have the same router - did anyone come up with a working coupler size? Looks like 5/16ths and 3/8ths were the candidates?

---

Posted on **2017-03-30 11:53:54** by **Bar**:

I tracked down one in the shop here and at least for the Bosh RA1161 Base S you are looking for an 8mm shaft coupler. Budget at least half an hour to get that knob off...sheesh. It's just a press fit, but without a special puller it's a tough one.

Yeah that's why I like the bolt solution. Imagine getting it back on!

---

Posted on **2017-03-30 17:48:07** by **tntahan**:

Well.... In that case Bar, can I/how do I change my order that I already placed from a 5/16th to an 8mm?

---

Posted on **2017-03-30 17:52:45** by **Bar**:

Hannah is the person you want to talk to about that. You can email her directly at Hannah@maslowcnc.com or send us a Kickstarter message. Which ever is easiest for you.

Guys do you think Bosch 1440 Ace router would do the job in place of ridgid? Looks like the only price comparable in Germany https://www.bosch-do-it.com/gb/en/diy/tools/pof-1400-ace-3165140451697-199905.jsp

---

Posted on **2017-04-03 06:00:28** by **msmollin**:

@badaboomberlin does that Ace come with a fixed base as well? or is it plunge only? I think Maslow expects fixed base routers only.

---

Posted on **2017-04-03 06:18:13** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

Some plunge bases have a setting that "captures" the depth stop adjuster and it acts much like a fixed base router at that point. It's hard to tell from the pictures if that one has the feature but it's something to keep in mind when recommending fixed-base only.

At 2:00 of this (Russian?) video it looks fit for Z-Axis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd3B4rHp-aQ

Posted on **2017-04-04 07:52:39** by **badaboomberlin**:

@msmollin good point! @TheRifleSpiral right, here in germany for i don't know why but routers are not the main tool displayed in the shops.. the search goes on..

---

Posted on **2017-04-04 07:54:30** by **msmollin**:

They're not the main tool displayed here on the east coast of the US either. At least in the two home depots around me, they're way in the back of the tools section.
