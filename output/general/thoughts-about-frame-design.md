## Thoughts about frame design
Posted on *2017-06-08 10:05:55* by *awildeep*

Hey everyone, I am planning my Maslow frame design out (I am still waiting on my kit to come in but my brain is going wild with ideas).

I know there is a temporary frame that can build the stock frame, but I was curious as to what else has been experimented with.  I am leaning toward the alternate design on the WIKI (https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechancs/wiki/Alternative-Frame-design-from-Beta-Testers) as it seems to be a frame that could be built solid enough without having to build the frame twice given some simple framing. (The sled I will likely remake via my Maslow).  This design also appeals to me as I can more readily mount it to my wall given the rectangular shape.

I know many of you have stock builds.  Anyone else experimenting?

Welcome, I could not wait for the kit so built a hinged version with a car jack for testing different angles. The squares where originally to try different motor positions, but I never got to try that.  [IMAG0565](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:yctn:imag0565.jpg.jpg) The is a metal frame (mexicanmilionare) and one that is mounted to the ceiling, so when the car needs the space it is pulled up. The are design concepts for one on wheels. Waiting for what you come up with. :-)

@gero Awesome.  this is almost exactly the same style I was considering.   

Did you use the measurements from the stock version or did you change stuff around?  

Do you notice any racking or stress on the sides that are dangling?   I think mine may require a bit more material, but having an outer frame is appealing.  It also gives me a way to potentially build a cover for the frame as well.

What have you found out about the angles?
