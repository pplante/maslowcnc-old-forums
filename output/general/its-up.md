Dude nice, Im still having trouble loading up files to Ground Control. Is there a video on that somewhere?

There's a "user's guide".

So when it says G-Code, and I have DXF files, I am going to have to convert the format, correct?

Yes.

I just watched this again, thank you so much for making the video, it was absolutely the highlight of my day. It feels so good to see that machine built by someone else. 



I can't wait to see what we can all get done in the next two months :)

Looks great!  Curious though...are you planning on using the rabbit ears or are you going with a 100% custom frame?

Thanks.  I probably won't build the ears unless there's some significant reason to.  The 2x4 alone is a little wiggly, but I'm going to add a 45 and that should make it fairly rigid vertically.  I am assuming the dimensions are the same as the rabbit ear config.  I don't know that they are.
