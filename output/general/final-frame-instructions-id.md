## Final Frame Instructions Ideas for change
Posted on *2017-04-29 09:23:03* by *mattnelson*

Looking at the building of the final frame instructions I had some minor suggestions.  I plan to run the screws attaching the front arm to the rear arm panel from the back (rather than the front) for aesthetics.  I plan to attach the arms to the sheet of plywood from the rear so that the screws will be pulling into the sheet that gets replaced, rather than the added wear and tear of having lots of screws driven into the arms over the years.  I will be sealing all of the endgrain of the 2x4s using Titebond III.  In my experience this makes wood last nearly forever even when exposed to water or moisture.  I will also be using 1.75 inch screws to install the braces to the 2x4s.  Supplied 1.25" screws will only be going into the 2x4s half an inch after going through the 3/4" plywood, I'd prefer a little more bite.  Everything will be coated in polyurethane when finished.

The screws from the back is a great idea. It's good for aesthetics, but also I've milled the heads off of a couple of those by not using a backing board so from the back is probably better for functionality too. I'm going to add a note about that to the wiki instructions, you can also if you would like to get the credit for that idea.

Great suggestions!
