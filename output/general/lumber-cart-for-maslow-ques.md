## Lumber Cart for Maslow question
Posted on **2017-03-24 11:12:48** by **tntahan**:

So I am a person that tries to make everything way to complicated. I always try and save space, and make things mobile so I can move them out of the way/store them or whatever. So here is my idea, I saw this picture of a panel cutting lumber cart and thought it was a cool idea to have to rip plywood, and then thought maybe I can make this and use my Maslow on it (maybe even still make it so I can cut sheets with a circular saw too). Anyways, please see the picture, does anyone see any problems with making something like this that has casters on it? Will it make the machine wobble or anything because of that and might throw it out of alignment?  [4906c85f1dfc8d54243d65cd9a2c11d0](/images/6p/xH/6pxH_4906c85f1dfc8d54243d65cd9a2c11d0.jpg.jpg)

that looks like a wonderful base to use, just replace the a-frame parts with that cart.



As for the casters, if you get locking ones you should have no troubles. If you use normal ones you run the risk that the cart moves when the router is moved around, which could end up with a resonance developing.

I agree with @davidlang, other than some common sense things like not having it roll away I think it should work great!

Resonance still could be an issue. At first I was thinking that the router makes only very high frequency vibrations, which shouldn't affect any reasonably strong frame. And if there were a problem with that I think Bar's machine should have already turned up the problem.

But the motors make fairly powerful medium to low frequency vibrations. That's mitigated by the facts that the frequencies are constantly changing, -and- the sled is constantly moving. So the whole assembly is almost never in a 'stable' state.

However the casters have an axle in the vertical dimension, all pointed the same way. It's not totally impossible that the axles and the bottom of the casters -could- rotate -if- the resonance is strong enough, regardless of the resonance not lasting very long. 

Resonance is weird stuff. Everyone's seen a washing machine walk around. With  casters. I'd feel more secure if there were also a small jack device that lifts the casters off the floor a fraction of an inch after setting the frame in position.

Another MAJOR plus of having casters would be to add a tiny generator at a low central point behind the main board, and run the router while pushing it down the street!! (The whole assembly then also needs a canopy to protect it from rain.)

good locking ones lock both the wheel and the shaft.

Look into retractable casters. Lower the wheels to move, then raise them so the base stands flat on the floor.

or locking feet

I'm excited by the possibility of a combining a panel saw with the Maslow! So far I haven't seen the router/bricks/sled move fast enough to make an assembly like tntahan's move much. Locking or retractable  casters will surely do the trick.

Actually, I think locking casters could be more stable than a wood frame in direct contact with the floor.  The rubber in the caster wheels would help to damp vibrations.  (Engineer's disclaimer: I haven't done any calculations or created a Campbell diagram, but that's my gut feel.)



I just posted my put at at multipurpose design.  It's really cool to see all the different ideas folks are coming up with.
