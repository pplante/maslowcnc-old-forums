Just curious, have beta testers been receiving units? I'm anxious to see what what the first impressions are.. I'd even be interested in an unboxing video or two. :)

The first batch is waiting for the post office to come pick them up now so you are just a little early, but you should get an answer in just a few days :-)

I was just as impatient when I was a kid.. Ironically this wait feels very much like Christmas Eve. :)

Personally, I'm hoping they send them out in reverse alphabetical order  :)

International kits are going out first (because you guys are going to have to wait the longest anyway) :-)

But, but... what about "America first?"

Sorry... had to. I'll stop now.

Reverse International order. Zambia and Zimbabwe first.
