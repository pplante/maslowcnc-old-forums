## Want to sell my Maslow
Posted on **2017-07-08 14:57:38** by **matthuck**:

I was extremely excited when I saw Maslow for the first time and backed it right away. However that excitement drew me into the world of DIY CNC and I already started on my own DIY CNC mill. It will be bigger, it will be much more expensive, but it will also be faster and more customizable than Maslow. Not to take anything away from this project as it is incredible. I just received my Maslow yesterday and since starting my own cnc mill, I don't think I will use it, which would be an absolute shame for it not to go to use. So I am offering it for sale for $350 plus shipping, or $350 picked up in Troy, Michigan. the cost of my kickstarter backing. If you want a z axis you will need to order that as I just did the $350 backing. Thanks *edit* guess i should add contact info, s101999@hotmail.com

Congrats to whomever scored this!  I would have jumped on this but am already committed to buy in the next round.
