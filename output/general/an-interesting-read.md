I've been looking for free plans for a CNC kayak frame and came across this article which I thought was an interesting read: http://www.clcboats.com/life-of-boats-blog/seventeen-years-of-cnc-machines-a-survey.html

Omg how many maslows can one make for $240,000? Lol

there's a space issue, those big machines move FAST. They go though several carbide router bits per DAY. In a week, they spend more on replacement router bits than the cost of a maslow.

it would take a lot of maslow machines to produce as many parts as that monster. The reason that those monster machines have two cutting tables is so that you can lay out the plywood and gather the resulting parts on one table while the machine is cutting on the other, so if you hussle, you can keep it cutting continuously.

As he said, the vacuum alone is huge (100A continuous current, costing tens of thousands of dollars)

And if a cut going wrong ruins a $100 sheet of plywood, you are very intolerant of things going wrong.

A really good read, thanks for sharing!

Reminds me of the good old days with my no-name Chinese desktop CNC that is collecting dust, but thanks to the Maslow will be reincarnated soon.

There are plenty of demons can take control of a CNC, specially if the control unit is attached to a ‚ÄúParallel Port‚Äù (if you don‚Äôt know what that is, enjoy your youth).
They can easily possess your machine.

CNC Exorcism:
All CNC demons have only one goal. To destroy your workpiece.
As with all demons, once you know their name, you can drive them out.
The easier ones come by the names of ‚ÄúScreen Saver‚Äù or ‚ÄúPower Management‚Äù. The Power Management can bury itself as deep as into the Bios of your PC, but once found, is driven out easy. The more difficult to find, come by the names of ‚ÄúCron Job‚Äù, ‚ÄúAuto Backup‚Äù and ‚ÄúAuto Update‚Äù. For a determined CNC Exorcist, they do not stand a chance.
One demon however, wasted a lot of my material and time.
A sneaky and shy one. It seemed as if it would only appear if I left the room and would disappear as soon as I came back.
The manual of the machine, tr anslated from Chinese, was of no help. It said things like ‚ÄòConnect cable to the then fisher boat sacrifice attach‚Äô. The Vatican in Rom was not interested in CNC demons, so I was on my own.
After 2 weeks of intensive research, finally a clue was found.
This demon could not be traced down to where it came form, nor could it be determined when and why it would appear and when not. But I had its name!
This beast came by the name of ‚ÄúStatic‚Äù.
Static is very nasty. It can build up to a strength that can create sparks and can destroy electronics.
On a CNC it stays invisible and will not reveal how it enters. Sadly I could not find any study on how it manages to ruin the piece you are working on. I believe that it can turn 0‚Äôs into 1‚Äôs and vice versa and enters the binary code.
To drive out Static I needed 3 pieces of rather thick copper wire. One went from the aluminium CNC frame to the metal housing of the control unit. The second from the control unit to the PC case. Third from the PC case to the Ground of a wall socket. (It might help if you sprinkle the wire with holy water and fold a cross in each piece of the wire)

The reason that the desktop CNC has collected dust after all demons were defeated was related to me cutting all cords to Microsoft and at that time Linux did not have much to offer on CNC.
Thanks to the Maslow I have discovered that a lot has changed and my choice of software does not exclude me from being a Maslowian.

If any demon would dare to enter the Maslow (Z-Axis :0), rest assured that an experienced CNC Exorcist is at your side.

Gero, you've already trapped and beaten several demons here. It's good to have your experience keeping an eye out for the Maslow demons! ;)

Was reading up about this static demon, from the vacuum pipes üòà
