## Electronics Assembly?
Posted on *2017-07-14 08:28:39* by *TheRiflesSpiral*

Is there a page at the Wiki that describes assembly of the electronics? (Attaching the motor shield to the Mega, where to plug in the motors, where to plug in power, etc...)

I couldn't find one.

Speaking of motor shield, I noticed that my motor shield only has 3 motor connectors. I thought that the shield was going to have 4 motor connectors since the drivers can run two motors each so we could use the "spare" for other "options" down the road or for emergency axis replacement. Guess it did not work out.

I just noticed the heat sinks in the bag too... definitely want to stress their importance!

Yes! All the steps can be found here: http://www.maslowcnc.com/assemblyguide/

and the electronics step in particular can be found here: https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Electronics/wiki/Electronics-Setup

@TomTheWhittler you are right that we used to have four. The fourth one was giving me a ton of problems, and didn't seem like it was going to work properly without delaying things so I took it off rather than leave it there and have it confuse things. I'd still like to make a 4 axis controller, and maybe a 6 axis controller as soon as I can

Understood. No use in adding problems. You are going to have your hands full for the next couple of weeks while all these MaslowCnc's are being assembled.

Ah! gotcha. That's a much better jumping off point than the one I was using. I'll update that working checklist page to start there instead.

Thanks, Bar!

Not sure if this is still valid for the new shield, but the wiki shows the right motor on the left side and the left motor on the right. The connection on the old shield was as  [IMAG0875](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:De2m:imag0875.jpg.jpg)

Great point Gero. I should really update that wiki page with pictures of the new board. I added labels for motor ports 1,2,3 to the board and took off the 4th connector which should make it easier

Whoops earlier today I put this in as an issue on GH.
