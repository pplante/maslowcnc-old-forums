## Curricular Integration?
Posted on *2017-07-01 08:55:18* by *mattnelson*

For those of us receiving a maslow for our school, I'm curious how everyone plans to integrate the maslow with their existing curriculum.  While my K-8 has a makerspace for student's free exploration with 3D printers, a laser cutter, and soon a maslow we also plan to use the equipment for projects connected to our state standards and existing curriculum.  For example, our NGSS science standards for 3rd grade involve the science of flight, perhaps the students can design gliders and a launcher and cut it out on the maslow.  What are your plans?

Disclaimer: I'm not a professional educator, just an engineer who mentors a high-school extracurricular robotics team.

I can envision a couple approaches to integrating Maslow into the curriculum.  First is based on what it can do.  Its potential for rapid prototyping of student designs offers numerous opportunities for science experiments (such as the aforementioned gliders).  At least one of my kids had a project where they had to design a game to teach something relevant to the class they were in (can't remember what topic).  With Maslow you could translate that game design into a durable game.

The other approach is based on what Maslow is.  There's lots of math and physics in the hardware and software, with gravity, friction, torque, forces, trigonometry, geometry all rolled up into this machine.

Teaching Maslow as a machine is interesting for people who are interested in designing such machines. (the advanced computer folks should experiment with improving the Maslow firmware/ground control software, this also teaches them to interact with open source projects)

Teaching Maslow as a tool to be used incidentally in other projects starts showing it's real potential.

You should be able to teach a good size class the basics of design (inkscape or similar) to construction in a couple hours, say an hour of classroom time going over the software, and then an hour or so of hands-on seeing the machine in action (with the safety briefings)

The maslow was designed to build human-scale stuff, so look around for what needs to be done and fill the need.

The Theater group will have a need to cut things for scenery.

What school doesn't come up with needs for desks, cabinets, display cases, etc from time to time.

Art classes need stands.

can the music department use new music stands?

people always grumble about chairs/stands/etc not working well, challenge them to design  something better.

there's probably some group that would like to build small scale versions of things. Use the Maslow to cut the walls/parts out of 1/4" plywood or foam.

Do you have a group doing drafting? do they want to see how things really look?

If you have a Science Fair, the month or two leading up to it should have the Maslow booked solid.
