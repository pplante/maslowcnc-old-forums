Hello,

to build the frame we need 2 sheets o plywood. Thickness is 3/4" (18 mm for me -  I'm Italian). But the height and the width of the sheets? Are they important? I don't know if here in Italy H and W of plywood sheets are the same than in USA.
And the 3 10 foot 2x4s?
I thing they are 3 rectangular wood pole 10' long (304,8 cm). And 2x4s? mean 2" x 4" ( 5,08 x 10,16 cm)?

with the latest design, you need an extra 2x4, the plywood is 4'x8', it's dimensions are not critical, so whatever the standard full sheet of plywood is in your area, it's support for what you will be cutting, so what you build with will match what you will be cutting.
