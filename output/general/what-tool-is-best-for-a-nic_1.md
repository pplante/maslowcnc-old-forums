Hey folks!Looking for a pro tip! After the cut is complete and you have to remove your project from the plywood sheet, what is the best tool to cut the tabs smoothly so less sanding will have to be preformed later? Maybe an Oscillating Dremel? Looking to purchase what I need before maslow arrives :)

a sharp chisel

the tab should be small and thin so a fairly light tap on a sharp chisel should do the job quite nicely.

the other option (if you are using a large enough bit) is a flush trim router bit on a trim router, cutting from the back (this also works if you don't do tabs, but just leave a small amount of material. This was shown on the PBS show "A craftsman's legacy", season 2 episode 13 "The Furniture Maker". It's faster to have the maslow not go up and down to cut the tabs and just leave a small amount everywhere.

I use an oscillating dremel, and it works great. You can use the part of the wood which is already cut as a guide for the blade and a lot of the time I can't even tell where the tabs were.

Another tip is that the top and bottom grain on most plywood is left to right so if you put your tabs on the parts where the machine is cutting left to right they will be easier to remove (although weaker).
