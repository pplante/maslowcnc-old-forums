The update is up! You can read it here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1830738289/maslow-cnc-a-500-open-source-4-by-8-foot-cnc-machi/posts/1826750



It's a little later in the day than usual because today was hectic, but so exciting.  Let me know if you have any questions or thoughts!

I'll bet that having the maslow a little closer to vertical would also help, it looks as if the weight of the chain pulls it back just enough for the sprocket to catch the edge of the chain.



wrapping a bit more around the sprocket will help, but I'd bet that you could still get in trouble if you tilted back a little more (so that the chain pulls towards the back a bit more.



This sort of problem will get worse over time as the chain picks up grit and/or gets a little rusty so that it doesn't flex as well. The overkill-but-sure-to-work solution would be to put a sprocket at the bottom of the dangling loop of chain and have a spring/bungie cord to provide some tension. This would both keep it from drifting towards the back a bit, and keep the chain seated on the sprocket better.



This isn't to say that your initial work-around is at all bad, just that this may be something to watch for in the future and/or find a way to test.

:-) We actually use a second sprocket at the bottom of the loop of chain with a bungee cord to tension it. I like the way you think. Right now the bottom bungee cord anchors in plane with the wood, I think it may need to move forward a few inches to make everything fully aligned

I wish I had the space to build one right now, but since i don't, I can't participate  in the beta :-(



if you tilt the machine back it should make the problem worse, and if you can steal a length of bicycle chain that's old and stiff, you can simulate an old machine (heavy grease and sawdust on the chain may simulate it as well)
