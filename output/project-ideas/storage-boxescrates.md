## Storage boxes/crates
Posted on **2016-12-12 13:40:13** by **nathanmiller**:

The other day it dawned on me Maslow would be great at cutting press fit (or glue together) storage boxes. They could be attractive closet boxes, or designed to fit anyone's shop. I found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOsIYygtg7g

But I haven't found plans yet.

oh sweet! That's exactly what I was thinking about!! Those could be made to be very attractive for in the home, stacked on a shelf, or very plain to be storage in the shop/garage. Thanks for sharing! This'll have to be a test project when I get my Maslow. :)

You could really do this with anything with a little design time. I am the leader of a boyscout pack and plan on running the machine to cut out toolboxes, bird houses.

 The boys love to build things and hopefully i can get them interested in some of the design.
