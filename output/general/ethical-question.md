## Ethical Question
Posted on **2017-01-11 14:06:43** by **Bar**:

I have a little bit of an ethical question for the community. I saw a little table that I liked on the internet the other day here: http://www.untothislast.co.uk/collections/coffee-tables/products/compass-side-table-35cm It took maybe 15 minutes to draw up in Sketchup  [TableCAD](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:wF7F:tablecad.jpg.jpg) and I built my own version  [TablePicture](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:HwYk:tablepicture.jpg.jpg). I feel OK about building my own, but is it ethical (or even legal?) for me to share the files? 

My design is necessarily a little different because I was working from pictures. Looking at both of them side by side now I can see that their legs are quite a bit thinner which I like.

I think this is an important question to ask. There are a ton of really cool CNC projects on Pinterest, many of which are very easy to copy and I'm not sure where the line between inspiration and stealing is.

What are everyone's thoughts?

uild copyright is extremely limited, you are supposed to be inspired by what you see and build on what others have done. Nobody designs anything without being influenced by what they see

An exact copy of something being sold is questionable, but by definition, anything you build from your own plans is not going to be an exact copy.

You may attract a lawsuit if you try to sell it and claim that it is someone else's exact design. But if it's just a close copy and doesn't try to claim to be someone else's design, you should be in the clear.

Thanks, that's good to know. What about from an ethical perspective?

Three legged tables are a dime a dozen, but what about something  more unique like this bike rack: http://www.periproductsllc.com/ .

I reached out to the owner to see if he would be interested in selling me the design files, but I never heard back.

copyright only covers direct copying and making derivatives. It doesn't cover 'inspired by'. Copyright also can't cover anything that's purely functional, which significantly limits it's applicability to what we are talking about. In practice, you can copyright the blueprints for a bike rack, but not the idea of a curved bike rack to hold a bike vertically (that would be a patent, if you could get it). It's not possible to make a derivative of plans that you have never had access to.

Trademarks exist to protect consumers from being tricked by phony products. If a design has a trademarked logo, or the design itself is distinctive enough to essentialy be a logo in it's own right, then copying the trademarked element implies that you are trying to trick consumers into thinking that you are part of that company, or are endorsed by them. So stay well away from trademarks.

Patents cover ideas, but the ideas must have a practical result/effect (well, mostly, there is a category called "design patents", but that is a rather messy field and not used a lot, outside of massive co mpanies that have buildings of lawyers on staff like Apple), but there are not a lot of patents around in the field of furniture design. There have been, but they expire in <20 years, so just about all of them have expired. If someone claims to have patented something, first check if it's actually patented, or if it's just 'patent pending', most patent applications don't result in an actual patent, in part because getting a patent first requires identifying everything in your idea that overlaps what someone else has thought of first, and then you can patent what's left (and if you want to build what you've patented, you now have a list of other people's patents that you have to implement to build what you invented, so you need their permission to build your own idea...)

The US Constitution authorizes Congress to issue patents and copyrights for a limited time for the purpose of improving society by encouraging inventors to share their secrets, in exchange for a limited-time monopoly of them.

Now, if you go out to make as exact a copy as you can, taking precise measurements, to reverse engineer blueprints, then you are pushing the boundary, and pushing hard. But it may very well still be legitimate.

So back to ethics. In spite of what Hollywood and the music industry would like you to believe, the purpose of patents and copyrights is not to make people rich, it's to get information out there, and the scope of what's infringing is far smaller than what they would like you to believe.

So go out and be inspired by what other people have created, and create your on take on their idea (just like they did for other people's ideas), just don't try to make an exact copy, and especially don't try to make something that will be mistaken as being made by a particular company. If you stick to these rules, you are working within the intent of the various Intellectual Property laws.

Lots of discussion about legalities here; I'd like to weigh in on the ethics question. This is just my personal opinion and is based entirely on my former life as a graphic designer. There are only so many ways to accomplish any given design goal. Truly creative solutions to common problems are few and far between.

On the occasion of a designer using a given solution to a design goal that is similar (or even identical) to a source of inspiration, the work created is still, I believe, the work of that designer and not that of the inspiration. The work can and should be presented as that of the designer and if they choose to divulge their inspiration, all the better.

Now this notion is different from copying a work. If a designer strives to simply duplicate a design with no contribution of their own I think it's unethical to then claim that design as their own. With regards to sharing that design, it really must be with consideration for the originator. Permission, ideally but certainly with credit due in no uncertain terms.

These kinds of discussions amongst my co-work ers at the ad agency always devolved into "how different does a design have to be before it's not a copy" and I really hated the discussion because it always felt to me to come from a place of "I copied this work and want to change it enough to keep from getting in trouble." The thing was, they were all talented enough to take an idea here and there and make it their own but sometimes just got lazy.

Copying a work for your own use, however, is your prerogative. Particularly in the realm of "making" where there are somewhat specialized skills involved. If you can pull it off, more power to you!

In my opinion, copyright and patent laws are not in place to encourage innovation but rather hinders innovation, you cannot innovate without standing on the shoulders of giants, consider where humanity would be if early man cared as much about intellectual property as we do today, imagine where we would be if we could never build off of the invention of fire, or the wheel, or agriculture, so long as you don't try to take credit for someone elses work there should be no problem building on someone else's design

I like that Bike rack design. Am I going to call up PeriProductsllc and find out how much that rack will cost me. Not likely as from looking at the fit and finish of the rack I am guessing it will cost as much as the Bike that it holds. Will I Sketchup one and make my own with Maslowcnc. That is more likely than buying one from PeriProductsllc. Am I going to make a bunch and go into business against PeriProductsllc. No. I feel that would be unethical. Would I post my Sketchup design for other Maslowcnc users to build their own. Yes, as I feel that if I took the time to design it up than I should be able to share if I want. Is the PeriProductsllc unique. I am not convinced as I remember a bike rack like this made out of PVC tubing years ago so it might have been their inspiration.
Of course there is this wooden bike rack plan.
http://www.instructables.com/id/Bike-rack-of-wood/
so maybe that was their inspiration.
I did find a external link to the PeriProductsllc bike rack which indicated it was around $ 300.00

Not gonna lie.... I would pay $300 for that bike rack.

---

Posted on **2017-01-12 06:12:39** by **TomTheWhittler**:

After I found the link with the price I was thinking the same thing. I really doubt that I could build one to look like that for $ 300.00. Of course I would build it just for fun.

---

Posted on **2017-01-12 09:19:08** by **TomTheWhittler**:

Apparently the link that I had that stated the price was $ 300.00 was wrong. It is listed on Amazon
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0187ZPZFE
as $575.00 plus shipping.

Ouch. That's getting closer to what I would have to charge to make any money on it... materials alone (that looks like it's made of hardwood) would be in the $150 range.

I think it's actually stained plywood. The parts are cleverly designed to all be cut from a single 4x8 sheet where the two uprights form a bit of a yin yang pattern when they are placed on the sheet. The top and bottom parts are made from stacked layers which are cut from within the openings in the main uprights. 

Its a little more apparent how they did it in some of the other colors, especially this one:  [Plywood edges](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:V6EQ:plywoodedges.jpg.jpg) 

It's not just the design which I think is beautiful but also how they figured out how to build it from a single sheet. I would like to support the designer, but at $575 you could buy a Maslow use it to build a bike rack and throw it away and still come out ahead.

Ah! Well that brings the material cost down significantly. Well, I say use it as inspiration, make one in your own style and share away!

for some thing as simple as a round table with 3 legs. I wouldnt' loose any sleep over it. anyone can come up with that easily on their own.

In the industry I work in there are companies that sell aluminum boxes that hold a camera, printer and computer that are automatic photo kiosks. They are often grossly overpriced $2000 or more for an empty metal shell. Materials costs are about $300 and 8 hrs labor for perspective. Anyways I started drawing similar ones and giving the files away for laser/plasma cutters so people can make their own. 
 
You will always have people that think if they make a triangle shaped widget they somehow should get a commission on any triangle shaped widget. These people's ego's are way too big. If they don't want people making something similar they can file a design patent. ironically hardly anyone does and even if they do they have to be pretty specific what the design patent covers, otherwise anyone can just make a few minor changes.   I've had two companies try to get me to stop this. they send me fancy letters from their lawyers and then I ask if they have a design patent and they just go away. all smoke and mirrors, trying to stifle open source.

I see no ethical problem of any woodworker seeing something they like and duplicating it for his/her own use. Copying for commercial purposes is where the line is drawn.

company's copy other companies designs all the time, nothing unethical about it IMHO. Windows copied apples' OS, iphone clones, clothing styles, pretty much invasive in any industry.

So it looks like most people are in agreement that you can see something you like and make your own version for non-commercial use.

But what about then sharing those designs online for free? It's still non-commercial but it's obviously propagating much further.

I certainly get the impression that some of the people in this discussion wouldn't have a problem with sharing the designs. But is that the general feeling of the group here?

Posted on **2017-01-18 05:29:07** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

My opinion is that if you've prepared a sketch/drawing suitable for cutting on a Maslow, it's yours to do with as you please regardless of the inspiration for the design. That would include sharing the design or even charging for it... You're not giving away the piece itself (Bar isn't about to start making 3-legged stools and shipping them all over the country for free) but if the design makes it into the hands of a maker who cuts one out for themselves, the company who inspired the design wasn't likely to get that sale anyway.

Copying is copying. No way around it. But your drawing is hardly a copy with very many differences from the other design. Even minute changes creates a new product, or even optimizations in fabrication could be enough to consider it different.

Bar, I don't think you are very far into the ethical quagmire here.  Yes, your version is very similar to the one you saw, but you didn't copy it verbatim, you didn't take measurements off of the original, you didn't swipe someone else's drawing files.  All of those would be much more problematic.  Still, there are many industries where blatant copying is the norm.  The fashion industry is one.  That's why designers keep coming out with new stuff, to stay ahead of the competition.  There are some folks within the industry who would like to protect the designs, but most recognize that the moment you do that, the rate of innovation slows dramatically.  Instead of racing to come up with new designs, everyone races to file patents and hire lawyers.

I can't guarantee that the original designer won't be unhappy about you "copying" his/her design.  It might be a professional courtesy to contact them and thank them for the inspiration.  But in truth, even if every Maslow  CNCer made a copy for themselves, the market for the original would not be diminished much, because consumers will buy and makers will make.  My recommendation is to view "Everything is a Remix" and relax.

Lol yea, the whole point of 'CNC' is to basically be able to copy with precision right?
