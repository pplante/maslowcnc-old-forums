## Limited Quantity?

I already backed so it doesn't impact me directly. But I'm curious what's going to happen when the limited quantity in the Kickstarter is gone.

I appreciate when Kickstarters do this because it seems like it makes you more likely to deliver the expected goal on time. But it's also sad for people wanting one. Would you add another pledge level with a later date for the next batch?

We're not exactly sure yet :-)

Adding another pledge level is an option, but not a guarantee. 

We're really focused on delivering on time. I've seen too many projects get to big and then not deliver be able to follow through. If we did make another level it would ship a couple months after the initial batch.

The only concern with making another level is that ships later is if the community gets too big, I won't be able to give everyone the attention I'd like. It's all about the community, answering your questions and adding the features you are looking for.

That being said, it's also all about creating a community which helps as many people build as much cool stuff as possible.

The other thing I'd like to avoid is pushing people into the beta tier who really just want a regular machine. If that's all that's left that's probably what's going to happen. 

There's no point in charging people for something they don't want, and our beta testers are really an awesome resource to get more people contributing to the open source project. 

Right now I guess I'm leaning towar d opening another tier, but pushing the ship date for the second tier back far enough that we can really focus on tier one and not worry about the next batch until we are done with the first.
