Just a little tip, if you call and place your order for a router or wood or whatever on the PHONE and tell them you have a lowes 10% off coupon. they will give you 10 to 15% off any order. I used to buy the 10% off coupons on ebay, but then my local HD got fussy and would only accept certain kinds in person. so now I just order over the phone. Also be sure to mail in your warranty card to upgrade the router warranty to LIFETIME. I'm sure running a router on a CNC is going to do a lot of extra wear and tear on the motor. If you need a drill HD has the Ridgid 18V one for sale for $70 till the end of the month and that includes lifetime battery replacement. in addition if you want a cordless tab breaker get this ridgid one  http://www.homedepot.com/p/RIDGID-18-Volt-JobMax-with-Tool-Free-Head-Kit-R862006KN/300146406

OR just get a cheaper $20 harbor freight one.
