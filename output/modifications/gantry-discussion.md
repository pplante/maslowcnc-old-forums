## Gantry discussion
Posted on **2016-11-09 13:51:01** by **chadzimmerman**:

Ok, I have seen it floating in Kickstarter comments section, but I wanted it to have a home here.

I really like the idea of a gantry setup for Maslow, in my case it is the solution to some questions I had been pondering.  Such as how I would handle slab wood.  I am talking stuff 3 to 5 inches thick and irregular shape.  I can see using Maslow to surface plane the slabs level.  But would also be a good way to cut out letters for signs.

The gantry could be height adjustable and give you a stable and smooth flow over rough work surfaces.  This would play well with the roller chain setup though. It would have to be adjusted out to compensate.

Ok, in my mind I have it all designed out... now, to try to make it in a more visual form.  Though, I do better with graph paper than Sketchup :)

I am also working on a "cheap" gantry design using the top bar (1-3/8") from a chain link fence (< $9.00 Menards SKU: 1715301), 90 degree fence corner connectors (<$ 3.00), and some roller bearings. My goal is an X-Y gantry to surface "relief" a panel. In the next few weeks I will "throw" something together and get some pictures posted.

I am thinking 3/4" electric conduit.  My current design would also move the bricks off the router sled.  They can be mounted on the conduit instead.

I would be afraid the 3/4" electrical conduit would flex too much. If you are making a top and bottom X rail system that spans 10 feet to cover a 8 foot sheet of plywood then the middle of a 3/4 flex's a lot. That is why I'm going with either the Fence Rail (1-3/8) or the larger electrical conduit (1-1/4). The cost difference is not that much. The frame I a thinking of making for the X and Y axis is based upon this youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu5UU10F7NQ) at about the 1 minute mark where he is showing the Y axis example. I actually thought of this idea before I came across the video. It is sometimes amazing how people come up with the same idea independently. When I was checking out casters I found they wobble a bit so I will be using some real bearings. I am still sources parts and cost.

Hmm, you are right.  I checked a piece I had, was able to bend it about a 1/2" over the 12'.

Larger conduit would be needed. Or maybe go to U or C channel.  It is not a need now feature, so it can be researched more.

Rigidity in a tubular medium is best achieved using a material with large, consistent crystalline structures. Black iron pipe comes to mind. Conduit and fencing are galvanized and therefore annealed to a certain extent. The wall thickness to overall diameter is higher as well in black iron pipe. You might check into Unistrut too. it's meant to span large distances supporting quite a bit of weight and has the added bonus of standardized mounting hardware.

Usually black iron does not has a consistent smooth finish to roll upon..  Unistrut might work with a couple of v-pully's riding the edge. Great ideas.

my goto material for gantry construction is the makerslide

https://www.inventables.com/technologies/makerslide

when used with good v-groove wheels ( https://www.inventables.com/technologies/steel-dual-v-wheel-5mm-bore for example) it supports plenty of weight and is easy to build with.

you can also get steel rails that clamp to plain extrusions to create the same profile (I don't have a link to them handy) This way you can use however think an extrusion as you think you need.

Reviving this old thread. I am very interested in Maslow for what it is but I, also, would like to plane slabbed wood. Anyone build this out?

I won't be working on that till after I get my Maslow and get the Z-Axis fine tuned.  It would not be that hard to add onto the Maslow frame I would think.

@penguinv22 you would be much better served by a router sled than a Maslow for flattening slabs. There's really nothing about Maslow that makes it a good choice for this task.

You can build one in an afternoon with just a sheet of 3/4" plywood and a circular saw.

Not trying to discourage you, but if you want to get at it now, you don't need to wait on a Maslow, then try to figure out how to do it.

Thanks, I appreciate the feedback. The set and forget aspect of Maslow was appealing but I realize it might not be the best tool for the job. For tohers who might be interested in building a router sled, I've seen some great YouTube tutorials on how to make a router sled and there is this fancy version by Nick Offerman in Fine Woodworking: http://www.finewoodworking.com/2011/09/29/level-big-slabs-in-no-time-flat.

I have the offerman plans tucked away for a rainy day.. And a bigger workshop
