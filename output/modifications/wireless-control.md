Have you thought about making the software wireless, just thinking of dust getting into the computer. Or maybe an sd card addon.

Yes!

What I would like to do eventually is make the default controller an android phone or tablet which connects via bluetooth. There are so many amazing cheap android touch devices out there. We will always support all the OS of course, but I think the android/Bluetooth combo would be slick.

Modern 3D printers (and probably other devices) frequently have a SD and LCD. It adds about $15. There's only basic machine control and no file editing but super cheap and easy.
