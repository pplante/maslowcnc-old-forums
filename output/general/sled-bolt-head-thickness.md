## Sled bolt head thickness?
Posted on **2017-03-21 19:17:49** by **mattnelson**:

I have access to a large CNC machine to cut out my maslow, I'm planning on pocketing out most of the contact surface of the sled to reduce friction.  How deep would this pocket need to be so that all the bolt heads are recessed?

Very cool, so the parts will be more precise than if cut on a temporary Maslow. Not that the impreciseness of the temporary is very bad because everything can be adjusted and tweaked a little, but every little bit helps.

Not necessarily a good idea. I think Bar tried something like this and thenumber of -potential- 'points of hangup' increased drastically.

I think 'less area less friction' is a minconstruence. Friction is a function of weight/area. If you decrease the area, with the same weight, the friction is simply focused on a smaller area.

The sled should be as large, flat (with upcurved edges,) slippery-smooth and featureless as possible.

The router mounting hardware isn't included because that's different for every router.

The chain attachment brackets have flathead countersunk screws so all it needs is a minor counterbo re, but I can't see by eye what the angle is. They're hex drive with hex key included. [Mcnc-sled-l-bracket-bolts-01](/images/yt/ytse_mcncsledlbracketbolts01.png.jpg)

put a giant sheet of Teflon or UMHW plastic under the sled, those plastics will glide over anything with very very little friction. you can even buy rolls of uMHW tape probably easier to find than a sheet

some time ago we were talking about this and it was pointed out that the easiest/cheapest way to get a sheet of plastic like this is to buy a cutting board like:



https://www.samsclub.com/sams/bakers-chefs-commercial-cutting-board-15-x-20/126035.ip?xid=plp:product:1:1



$9 each (but I think if you order them online you have to buy a minimum of 2)

I picked up one of those Sams Club cutting boards and I think it will work as a sled. Very slick. Now waiting for the non-beta MaslowCnc.

You can also pick up those type of Hex bolts at any Ace Hardware store.

Another option: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070Z8I34/ - my sheet won't arrive until Friday so I can't speak to it's slippery-ness but seeing as it's also HDPE I expect it'll function just fine. Worth noting that it's only 1/8" thick so probably not viable as a sled by itself but in conjunction with a plywood backer it should work just fine (though getting them to stick together may be a trick - either CA glue or extra-hot hot glue is the best bet outside of specialty glues for PE).

Ca glue wont work and hit glue will fail quickly best is speay adhesive

CA might work but it's difficult to adhere large surface areas because it requires moisture in the air to set. It might work if done in the 'old style' method of applying the CA to one surface, dampening the other surface, AND clamping and allowing to set. Still a tossup.

Spray, 3M '77' is awesome.

For large surface areas carpet tape is awesome.

Side notes... Not applicable for this application because they're only 1/2" wide, but I mention them for extreme/difficult situations.

For single sided applications, one of the most amazing tapes is Blenderm surgical tape. (Not the common fabric backed tape.) It's stretchy, designed to stick to greasy, sweaty, dirty, flexible human skin, and it -works-.

For double sided applications, 'fashion tape,' Aleenes Fabric Fusion, was designed for the fashion industry to do adjustments and modifications of clothing on models, for quick fixes backstage at fashion shows, and to actually stick the clothing to the model's body. So it also works excellent in wet/sweaty/greasy environments. It's consistency is a lot like rubber cement on a waxy  backing. When pressed into the grain of fabric itself it survives the laundry. It used to be available only at Aleenes but Michaels also has it now and I think even Walmart.

Side-side note... The ONLY liquid adhesive I have found to stick to NYLON is known in the model airplane industry as Formula 560 or canopy glue. It sticks to nylon to the point that it has to be scrape-scrape-scraped off! Interestingly, it dries clear, which is why it's used for attaching clear canopies to models. It's only shortcoming is that it is not waterproof. Available at any hobby shop that does model airplanes.

Going back to the original question, the heads of the bolts which hold the bricks are 15mm in diameter and 5mm deep. The heads of the bolts which hold the chain brackets are 19mm in diameter with a 45 degree slope to the shaft.

A nomenclature detail. These are called 90 degree countersink bolts. Myself, I used a plain 7/16 drill. Wrong angle but not a big deal.
