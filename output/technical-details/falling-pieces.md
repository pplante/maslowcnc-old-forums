## "Falling" pieces

I'm not sure how to phrase this question, but do you have issues with the piece you are cutting out falling "loose" and sliding down as you cut it? How have you handled that?



I mean I could see taping/clamping/screwing (even a vacuum board setup) if needed, but your demo videos don't seem to have that.

Great question. There is a software option to leave "tabs" which will hold your part in place until you are ready to remove it, then you can cut them with an exacto knife, and sand the piece smooth. 



That being said, I usually don't bother. Gravity seems to hold the parts in place well for all the materials I usually cut. I think the fact that the router is pressed against the wood helps.
