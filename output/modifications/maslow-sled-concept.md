## Maslow Sled Concept
Posted on **2017-06-28 03:35:32** by **iroc999**:

First WOW! Very Happy to have stumbled across the Maslow. I've got a sled Concept to offer up. IT wouldn't let me post with my images. So I uploaded a screen capture as I navigate the 3D model. It's O.D. is 18". The material would be 3/4" MDF so it's good and heavy, might could lose the bricks. I didn't have dimensions on the R2200 router so I was just spitballing. The design would need to be modified, but it gets the idea across. It's 3 Concentric Rings with 5 Spokes. It's constructed using the Layering or Stack Fabrication method. Which the Maslow makes nice and possible. The 5 Spoke design and stack fab allow for cutouts to reduce drag by reducing surface area. While still maintaining maximum contact patch. The 5 Spoke design also helps get the Chain mounts in great location. The two lower mounts can hold the Z-axix motor and any additional weight. While the top could be used in conjunction with a low cost optical tracking system that can be connected to the Arduino. Which I figure could help get to reach the 1/64" tolerance. IDK just guesstimating on if that would wo rk or could even be used simultaniously with teh GCode output. 



Anyway here's the Link to view the short video  https://youtu.be/Vu2mM3zOYMY

The OD of the Ridgid fixed base is a shade over 6". Generally, reducing surface area increases friction, not decreases it. Particularly in a situation where edges could be snagged after cutting them. It's a beautiful model though, Let us know how it works out!

@TheRiflesSpiral but i don't think it would increase friction. As far as the sled and the material are concerned the over all area that the sled covers is large. 18" diameter. I don't know what the dimensions on the current sled are. I'f it's O.D. is >18" I would adjust my design acordingly. Like I said I was spitballing and figured 18" was roughly the same as the current actual sled. I wouldn't think the Cutouts would reduce that over all area. My current standard router table and table saw use the exact principle. With cutouts and grooves in their surfaces. While still allowing materaial to slide effortlessly across them.  The over all area "Contact Patch" is still the same. and the rounded over edges help to prevent snags. But I could be wrong...

The ribs that you find in cheap router tables and table saws are intended to improve flatness during manufacturing when using lightweight castings of aluminium, not reduce friction to the workpiece.



The castings come out of the mold warped and a machining operation is used after painting to flatten it. A solid surface that size is slow and difficult to flatten (heat buildup can cause as much or more warping) so they cast grooves into the top, making machining faster and easier.



You won't find ribbed tables in cast iron or other machinery where quality castings are found. For instance, your router table (and many you find made from aluminium castings) has ribs, [but quality tables](https://www.infinitytools.com/universal-router-table-top-with-aluminum-plate) don't. In fact, most high quality router tables have abandoned metal for the majority of their surface in favor of a pressed wood product that stays flat. (the inserts are usually aluminum still.) But the best ones are cast iron. Same with table saws, where you'll rarely find aluminium on the top. (perhaps some exte nsions, but they're usually steel)



Your sled is probably fine; even if it does hook edges or doesn't glide smoothly as you like, you could always add a sheet of HDPE or UHMW to the bottom... can't wait to see it in action!

I second the view that a flat base plate will move much smoother than one with holes. The problem is you get rough edges on the cuts. Rounding off the spokes will help but each spoke is an extra 'impact' point causing a bump. Whereas a flat base only bumps once and then rides over the top. Also, this is a stack of four sheets of 3/4" MDF? So 3" thick? I think you will need to mount the router on the bottom sheet not the top one. Routers only have limited travel and cutter bits are made deliberately short for strength. If the router base is 3" from the work surface, you might not be able to cut anything!

PS: Also bear in mind that MDF is nasty stuff to work with. Saw dust in general is not good for you but I believe MDF dust is especially toxic.

Posted on **2017-06-29 17:06:40** by **iroc999**:

@John The entire bottom piece is filleted ( rounded over ) to avoid any snag points. 



Yes MDF is bad to breath, but that's what the vacuum hose is for. If what you are building/Cutting is intended to have a smooth clean surface. Then the only things that are of close to or equal suitability solid wood or furniture grade PVC  ( or Acrylic what most know as plexiglass ). Both of which when routed will still produce fine dust that's not good to breath. The wood dust collects moisture in the lungs, The MDF dust collects moisture in the lungs and has formaldehyde, and resin dust. The PVC tons of chemicals. That's why this design has coutouts and channels to ensure the maximum dust collection throughout the entire sled and not just kind of around the router.



Personally I'm not worried about MDF dust. I've been wearing a respirator while I work with it for over 20 years. Though even if someone just made this sled out of it and never cut it again, the weight, smoothness benefits to the Sled outweigh the dangers of a one time cutting MDF. The ultimate would be this design in Al uminum,  but that's not getting cut on a Maslow. While MDF can easily be cut with a Maslow. Once I'm lucky enough to purchase a Maslow kit I'll be cutting 97 to 3 MDF - other materials. I even plan on collecting the MDF dust to mix with Fiberglass resin to make a bondo like gel/putty that i use when making sub enclosures.

@TheRiflesSpiral I wasn't saying that the cutouts and grooves reduce friction. I was saying that they exist and the material still slides across the work surface almost effortlessly. Showing that the holes in the design will not cause the Sled to bindup and drag on the material as the sled moves across the surface. Many many tools use this exact principal in their guide designs. Heck the router in question has a huge hole in the middle, much larger than is required for the tool/bit/endmill. That hole does not effect the routers guide negatively at all. They still slide almost effortlessly across the material. Trust me the design would work better than a solid sled. Simply on being able to better remove dust from the work area, that could build up under the sled. It would work better if it had a brush that surrounded the Sled, But that would be hard for someone to manufacture with the Maslow alone. Not impossible, but would take some work. Since all the bristles would have to be hand placed, but i digress. There's no way a design like this would negatively effect Sled per formance. An 18" circle is going to ensure the sled stays perfectly flush with the material. Heck 18"  is overkill even. The job could be done easily with something like 10 or 12", but I was going bigger to help not need the bricks. Which I know is totally just me. I just would rather not have some bricks involved when I can get that weight built into the sled and easily incorporate a better dust collection system, cuz 99% of stock dust collection systems could be much better. 



Plus I think a beautiful machine like the Maslow should have a Sled that makes it look like the Pro it is. Which is why I offered up the design to the community. A design that sticks with the easy for the new Maslow owner to build with nothing more than the machine and it's parts and some lumber.

Posted on **2017-06-29 18:22:14** by **davidlang**:

actually, that hole in the center of the router needs to be that large to handle some of the larger bits.



But the normal router use doesn't worry about the friction of moving it around, there is always more than enough force available.



decreasing the surface area that the weight is spread across increases the weight on the remaining area. When you then have some unknown portion of that area in the air (because the material below it has been cut away), the effective area shrinks more.



The current thinking (resulting from experimentation) is that the lower psi of the larger surface area and fewer edges that can catch on the workpiece of a larger sled is an advantage.



but we've changed the sled design before, so if experimentation says that another design is better, we can change it again.

why is it 3 layers thick?

---

Posted on **2017-06-30 03:43:03** by **iroc999**:

@rollandelliot To be heavy to possible lose the bricks, and so that it can have channels to accommodate vacuum across the entire Sled.

---

Posted on **2017-06-30 05:53:32** by **davidlang**:

a vacuum across the entire sled is probably not a great idea, more sq in of surface exposed to vacuum will pull the sled against the workpiece harder, which will increase friction.

---

Posted on **2017-06-30 06:16:21** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

Do you mean dust collection? That's best handled at the source. (As near the bit as you can muster)

This thread has gotten me thinking about the sled design and quite honestly I'm not crazy about the flat plywood sled either. On gantry-style routers, the carriage which contains the spindle does is suspended above piece, which is especially useful on glossy laminates and veneers that scratch really easily. That's not possible with the Maslow design, so another solution would be necessary.



I've been trying to think of a better sled design while i've been planning out my Maslow, although admittedly I haven't gotten that far. I agree with iroc999 that there would be too much friction between the workpiece and the sled. Obviously it's not too much of a problem, because the beta testers have functioning machines. However, i like a good challenge and would like to improve the design if at all possible.



[IMG_20170630_131250](../../images/BV/hq/BVhq_img_20170630_131250.jpg.jpg) 



I finally had five minutes to come up with a napkin sketch on my lunch break. I still have yet to model it up in Solidworks and figure out what the problems of the design may be, so it's more of a concept than anything else. In  the cabinet shop were I work, we have roller ball setups on some of our conveyors to give us two axis of movement. If we were to use the same roller balls on the bottom of the sled, and space maybe 8 of them around the perimeter of the sled, we could get significantly less friction. This could have issues staying flat to the workpiece near the edges, but there may be a way to fix that issue. See: https://www.harborfreight.com/1-inch-roller-ball-bearing-67060.html



The other element that i'm trying to add in this design is a brush around the router itself to provide better vacuum for the dust collector. This could be as simple as buying some brushes and affixing them to the inside of the opening for the router bit. See: http://www.ebay.com/itm/70mm-Brush-Vacuum-Cleaner-Engraving-Machine-Dust-Cover-CNC-Router-Spindle-Motor/302319940592?_trksid=p2385738.c100677.m4598&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20160908110712%26meid%3D8210fc4d513f4bf9bb3a384fa3d32095%26pid%3D100677%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D5%26sd%3D332191435320 



Not sure how well any this will work, but I'd like to see where this leads :)

---

Posted on **2017-06-30 11:04:59** by **davidlang**:

how do you keep the roller bearings from falling into the cuts you have already made? The problems aren't just near the edges.



Before you go overboard in trying to seal the router area, remember that you need to have airflow in or you can't have airflow out to carry the chips away. A perfect seal would be the worst possible case. Personally, I suspect that just using the stock plastic shields on the router reduces the airflow too much.



It's worth pointing out that initially the sled was much smaller and more X shaped so that there was a minimum sq in of wood to rub against the workpiece. Over time it has evolved to a much larger disk.



The friction between the sled and the workpiece is an important factor (especially near the bottom corners), and we have had a lot of discussions about this. Some people have put large 'furniture moving' pads on the bottom of their sleds. Some people have made their sleds out of a slippery plastic (cutting boards are a cheap source of material for this)



Some people are looking at raising the angle of the machine so that there is less fo rce between the sled and the workpiece.



There have been a lot of ideas talked about and quite a few built. So far the basic disk sled has not been shown to be THE limiting factor, and it's easy to bootstrap, so it's still the suggested design.

Posted on **2017-06-30 12:08:30** by **Meticulous Maynard**:

The point of having 8 (or even more) rollers is to have redundancy. In theory, if one of the bearings would fall into a previously made cut, the others would pick up the slack. That wouldn't work in a big cut-out unless a spacer was placed inside it to keep the sled level. 



That being said, if it turns out to be more of an impedance than a help I'll just drop the idea altogether. The low-friction materials may be a better way to solve the problem anyways. I still am worried about scratching softer materials like veneers, but for the majority of Maslow users, that's probably a non-issue.



The idea of using a brush rather than the plastic shields is actually for airflow. There is space between the bristles, especially when pressed against a board. They are largely in use on commercially available machines. I'm just working out a way to use that on the Maslow. Admittedly, if the roller bearings aren't in use, then it defeats the purpose of needing the brush as well since that was my way of creating more vacuum at the workpiece when the whole sled was spaced 1 1/4" away.



I 'm not recommending this alternate design to replace the suggested design for the Maslow. I love how beautifully simple it is. Adding a more complicated sled makes the project more difficult and expensive. I'm just working on alternatives :P

[Here's a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufXTIu2VmME) from Marius Hornberger about making a dust collection brush for his CNC.

---

Posted on **2017-06-30 16:38:20** by **Meticulous Maynard**:

The more I think about this idea the more I don't like it. Originally I was worried about voids but in fact I should probably be more worried about raised edges near cuts. All it would take is for one of the roller bearings to get caught on something and the whole cut would get thrown off. I will need to think about this for some more time before I can come up with a working prototype.



@Rifles: That is a very informative video. Given me some good ideas, and quite a few questions. I like how he butchered a broom to get his bristles. I can see the advantage to using softer bristles. I will have to use some of his wisdom in my designs. Gotta love the Germans, they know how to make stuff!



Anyways, sorry to hijack the thread. Should have really just started a new one.

---

Posted on **2017-06-30 18:55:31** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

If there's one aspect of the sled that probably shouldn't change, it's the large, flat, smooth surface that rides on the workpiece. Nearly every quality power tool, stationary or handheld, has that as an attribute. Room for improvement lies in the attachment method (maybe) the excess weight (maybe) and dust collection which is typically a feature of the router.



Every beta tester has a standard -ish sled that departs only marginally from the basic design supplied with the machine and if there were major room for improvement by significantly altering that aspect of the sled, I think we would have seen it by now.

---

Posted on **2017-07-05 19:38:04** by **iroc999**:

@Meticulous Maynard no worries about hijacking, that's a given to be expected in any forum. Plus if it's still on topic like you were, it's not hijacking. It's sharing ideas.

Glad you saw that roller balls would be a bad idea. 

Love some Solidworks. I'm still stumbling to learn it. Mainly because it's not so much a concept oriented system. It's a fully realized Drafting oriented system, but my aim is to transition to it as my goto one day. 



I looked into PTFE which would be THE ABSOLUTE BEST MATERIAL to make the portion of the sled that makes contact with material. The problem with PTFE ( Teflon ) is the astronomical price. HDPE ( cutting board ) is the next best choice and still expensive, but way more reasonable than PTFE. Both are on the light side as far as weight/density.



I'd have to say the keys to any good Maslow sled would be large round design, and weight.  I picked up some laser modules that I'm now looking to add to the sled. So centering and homing manually. Don't know if Ground Control has the ablity to manually position the sled, but if it does then a las er mounted and aimed at the bits center point would really help speed up calibration. I even have been toying with the idea of mounting all 3 modules on the sled and putting three basicl LEDs at Top dead center of the Maslow frame and one on each side at center. When the laser hits the LED it will induce a current that can be read by the Arduino. Which could be added to the code of Ground Control easily. I'm not proficient in coding, but i figure something like



function centeringSled = home

 home = sledposition0,0,0

 seldposition0,0,0 = sensor1voltage active, senor2voltage active, sensor3voltage active

function sledIsHome = home True

function sledIsNotHome =home Flase

 new sensor1voltage

 new sensor2voltage

 new sensor3voltage

   sensor1voltage >0 =  active

   sensor2voltage >0 = active

   sensor3voltage >0 = active



   if sensor1voltage = 0 moveYaxisto0 =  home False

   else hold

  if sensor2voltage = 0 moveXaxisto0 =  home False

   else hold

  if sensor3voltage = 0 moveXaxisto0 =  home False

   else hold



  if sensor1voltage = active Yaxis hold

  else home

  if sensor2voltage = active Xaxis hold

   else home

  if sensor3voltage = active Xaxis hold



if home = True end



Hahaha Looks like I hijacked my own thread.

remember that the sled tilts, so the laser may hit your sensor when off-center.

---

Posted on **2017-07-12 21:29:53** by **iroc999**:

Well I wouldn't say tilts more rotates. The sled is there at least in part to limit/eliminate tilt, but i see where you are going. Could deactivate or just ignore the signals from the sensor during actual use. 



Could also switch to a SMD type led flush mounted, maybe evenly slightly recessed. That would limit the angle of attack greatly. Heck maybe just stick it behind a pinhole. That would likely be the easiest to achieve. Could still retain use of the much cheaper button type low grade led. since it's only for light detection purposes. Should they be made to light up once all are positively centered? I'd have to go with RGB SMD LED. :))  Cuz then you could use them to give all kinds of visual feedback/info. Like so many options there, cuz you've gots tons of colors, flash patterns, color changing patterns. That's too deep of a hole to be diving off into. 



I wonder how much it would cost to weave a wire grid under the bed and mount some rfid chips on the sled. That seems like a really good way to know exactly where the sled is and how the sled is performing at all tim es. I wonder how much a roll able antenna mesh that was 4x8 could be made for........ If you used rolls of that tool box liner over it. Your material would be held extremely firmly. Like I've used a piece of MDF on some saw horses with that tool box liner and hand routed speaker holes, chamfered and rounded over edges, and the material stays glued in place really well. Set your depth right and you barely nick up the liner and never touch your substrate. You can glue the liner or just lay in there. Though this being semi vertical id spray some glue on it let that tack up then lay it on the bed. Edges won't roll up that way. Then when it's ate up you pull it off and lay some more down.  IDK if the motor driver shield uses up all the available data pins or not, but NFC could get the system really good resolution.

That post about the sled mounted motors really peaked my interests. So I added it to my concept. Most of it could still be made with the Maslow it's self. Except the three metal motor mounts.

All I can really say about your ideas is "Try them"



I don't think you will get anywhere close to the accuracy that you are hoping for with your proposals, but I can be wrong.

---

Posted on **2017-07-13 10:52:02** by **Meticulous Maynard**:

I saw that post about the mounting the drive motors to the sled. Very interesting, curious to see how it effects the machine. I would also like to see how the non-slip liner will work for you. I have my doubts because, at least in theory, you will sacrifice a clean cut on the back edge by not cutting deep enough. I would love to be proven wrong though, because it sounds like that would be a pretty cheap alternative to a vacuum pump and easier than clamping the piece down all the time.



I only say Hijack because I was posting a (mostly) different idea from your concept. In hindsight, it didn't seem fair to move the subject of discussion away from your design. That being said, I haven't given up completely on my idea of the roller bearings, I think that the idea still might have merit. It will need a suspension to allow it to not get snagged on raised edges, and the bearings will need to be nearly flush with the surface of the sled. But I'm nowhere near a well thoug ht out concept and as such I'm going to rely on the stock sled for now. Hopefully my concerns about scratching veneers and such is a non-issue. Then I won't have to over-engineer something to work for my purposes :)

My brother had a suggestion that seems likely to be our go to method of securing pieces to our waste board; 23 gauge pneumatic pinner. We already have them in the shop, teeny little headless nails. After a first pass to mark out areas we may simply pop a few tiny brads in anywhere that needs to be affixed. Easy to remove, leaving only the tiniest hole. Should work for most of my projects were we don't need prestine surfaces

There are plastic nails available that work very well (they don't hurt the tools if you hit them with the bit)

Those plastic nails are pretty sweet, but the smaller size is still 15ga. Awesome for some applications. 23ga pins, while steel and would nick a bit, likely wouldn't cause catastrophic failure if you accidentally cut through them.

---

Posted on **2017-07-15 03:56:45** by **iroc999**:

As far as using small finishing brads. The headless thin nails. Myself and most of the custom car audio community have been just eating through them with routes for as long as I can remember. They do cause bits to wear faster, but we just figured that into the cost of supplies. Say like you take two disks bradded together, rounded over mounted on a 2x4 to hold it where you'd want your speakers to mount. Lay some stretchy fabric over the whole thing and resin. Spread resin mixed with mdf dust or powdered glass on the inside. let cure then route out the proper circles to recess and mount the speaker. That's usually twice you've run run through those brads. shaves them off clean as can be.  So I really wouldn't be worried about them. 



Though the new thing is template tape. It's a decent holding double sided temporary tape. Holds things really well and comes off. Does save on bit wear, but you still have the cost, since you're buying lots of another tape.



While I'm  here and instead of making a whole new thread. Does the electronics have an available output to trigger a relay to turn the router on and off remotely? Is that already a feature?

---

Posted on **2017-07-15 05:24:57** by **davidlang**:

Bar is concerned about the liability of switching the router on/off via software, so the firmware won't do that.



There are 6 extra GPIOs, so it could be wired up, and the firmware could be modified to control it, but it's not in place, and Bar won't write it.
