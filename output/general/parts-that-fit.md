## Parts that Fit
Posted on **2017-04-23 14:25:42** by **rancher**:

Since day one, I have been using test files with joined parts, and failing.  No surprise, as we have been going through the Beta process and I am starting from scratch in every aspect of this.

  I chose joined parts to get me up to speed on how to use CAD/CAM and because they would reveal machine error in a way that matters to me.  My plan for this machine mostly involves simple tab joined parts that don't need incredible resolution or accuracy, but do need to fit.  It forced me to buckle down and learn how to model in 3d and sort out the CAM process.  

I'm happy to say, as of this morning, I cut parts of my own design that fit together.  Thank you so much, all of you.  It works!

Wow, nice! CAD/CAM all from fusion?

Yes!  I am finally starting to understand it.

Cool! Glad to hear that it's all coming together for you. I can't imagine how many trips you had to make from your shop back to your house to check something on the Internet.

You know, now that the machine is cutting well without me constantly babysitting I've started referring to it as a "shop cleaner."  Because I'm finally getting around to cleaning my shop, hanging around down there with no internet while Maslow does the work.  I'm so stoked!

Dude that is so awesome. I can't wait to get to your level. Fusion is so confusing, but it just takes time. I'm watching a ton of youtube videos.

@rancher, would you consider putting the file into the Community Garden? I'm way behind you on the Fusion curve, but I'd like to make something more interesting than test cuts :)

Absolutely.  I'll zip up the four part files and put it up there shortly.

I built it using those old shelves I was test cutting on, so it cuts almost an inch deep.  You may want to manage Z depths manually on these.

I zipped it up, but I don't know how to Github well enough to put it in the CG.  I tried "upload", but it says I don't have permission and something about a push?  I can mail it to someone who understands that website.  That place totally confuses me.

That looks fantastic! Great work! 

Can I put that picture in the weekly update on Wednesday? (And give you credit of course) I think everyone would enjoy seeing it.

If you want to email me the files (bar@maslowcnc.com) I would be more than happy to put them in the Community Garden.

Of course you can use the photo Bar.  I emailed you the zip.

Did'ja see my new metric tape?

Hahah I totally missed it, just looked at all those beautiful tabs :-)

Thanks for sending me the files and letting me use the picture. I'll put the files up right now.

I got a kick out of the fact that you've been cleaning your shop while running the machine. I spent the day working on finishing up the assembly instructions which meant a lot of cutting parts...our space has never been cleaner :)

The files are up on the [Community Garden](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/CommunityGarden/tree/master/Ranchers%20Letter%20Box)!
