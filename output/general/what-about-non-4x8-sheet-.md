## What about non 4x8 sheet ?
Posted on **2017-02-11 17:45:19** by **excessnet**:

Just wondering, if I want to cut into a 1x8 plank of something, will it will ? I guess I will only have to "screw it" leveled somewhere in the middle of the Maslow ?

Something that would be really helpful in positioning a small piece on the base/back sheet would be to use maslow to create gridlines over the entire base sheet. Maybe a v cutter or 2 or 3mm cutter to cut grooves every 100mm or so vertically and horizontally. Or diagonally corner to corner. Or even mount a sharpie and just draw lines.

Also a few holes for pegs to sit the work piece on, then screw or clamp it to the base board.

one thing to remember is that the maslow does not have any position sensors, so it doesn't have a repeatable zero-zero mark (and the cutter height is also not detected)



this limits the values of such gridlines a bit.



as for pegs to mount things, the idea is that the weight of the workpiece does most of the work of holding things in place. but with smaller work other things may be needed



But that said, I expect that shortly after the maslow gets into people's hands, all sorts of modifications along these lines will appear as gcode files for people to download. :-)



some good samples of workclamps that would be good are at:

once I get my maslow, I'll probably create the g-code to put hold in the base for pegs and do some of these (or something very similar). I'll probably laminate a couple sheets of plywood together for the base an d try to rig up a zero-zero center to use (for compatibility with commercial benchdog hold-downs I'll probably make the holes 3/4" and try and use wood dowels so that I don't hurt the cutter if I hit them).
