## Engraving other than plywood

Would the Maslow  engrave something other than plywood say like a 1x12  for inlaying projects?

I would consider the Maslow project, like most CNC variants, to be somewhat material agnostic... provided your end effector (a router in this case) and tooling are appropriate for the material then I think your challenges lie solidly in the realm of accuracy.



Bar has stated an expected accuracy of 0.0156" (about 0.4mm) which may not be ideal for inlay work, but might be workable... I think it's just something you'll have to try out.



The challenges with a 1x12 really only come with mounting and positioning... how do you find and set center, how do you hold it in the machine, etc. Both easily overcome.
