Just nominated a 501c3 non-profit maker space I'm a member of. I know the first selections happen tomorrow. How many of the total pool will be awarded tomorrow?

That's awesome! I'm sorry I didn't see this sooner, I'm still getting used to the forum system. 



We ended up going with six organizations in the first week, and this week will be bigger probably 8. We're trying to spread them out evenly but all the numbers are always changing. The goal is to give them all away by the end of the Kickstarter, or maybe one week after if there are still some left :-)



Sorry for the vague answer, and good luck!
