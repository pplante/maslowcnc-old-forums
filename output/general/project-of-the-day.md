## Project of the day

I've been working on cleaning up the PID controller and improving the way gcode is sent to the machine this week and I wanted to cut something to do a real world test to see how things were going. I'd also bought the wrong size hose for the dust collector on our second machine so I just whipped up an adapter in onshape and cut it out. 



Something went wrong in my first attempt with the scaling and everything came out 1.5x size, but after a little tweaking I ended up with a nice interference fit adapter and a bracket to strain relief the hose.

My project was to build the new arm design. I also lowered my angle. Then again went through the calibration routine. It was easy and calibrated the first time!

Here the big one next to the right size one and the CAD just for fun

@blsteinhauer88



double check that the chain isn't going to hit itself when you go down to the bottom corners. That looks to me like the extra chain guide is just a bit too far out for everything to clear when the chains are closest to vertical.

This project will probably just sit around and collect dust
