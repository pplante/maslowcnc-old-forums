I'm a CNC artist and I love your project! I can't believe the timing because I'm running a Kickstarter for my CNC art at the exact same time! Here's my question: Can I use Maslow to cut Corian? I carve lithophanes with 1/4" Corian. My current machine is pretty powerful but I would love to teach other people how to make lithophanes with a more affordable machine.
I'm so excited about your project! I'm going to share it with my CNC friends and share it as an update on my Kickstarter project. Woohoo!

I think I just found the answer to my own question. :-) The z-axis has to be manually raised and lowered. So, not something I can use for cutting lithophanes. But, that's okay! It's an awesome machine!

Great question and great answer!

We're really more of a 2/2.5D machine.

I wasn't aware of lithophanes at all, but wow! What a cool art form. Sorry we couldn't help you. Your work is a great example of the kind of fantastic awesome new things we are hoping to encourage people to do with CNC machines. 

Good luck!

If the z-axis is using a variable motor, I don't see why this machine could not do lithopanes.

The router would need to be in raster mode also.
