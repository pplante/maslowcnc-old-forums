## CNC Workstation

I just have to many ideas of what the Maslow will cut first. I think I have reached a point that the first thing it should cut is a workstation for operating it.

But 'fast' isn't the point :) . I've wrestled sheets of stock to cut out cabinets, now I want to tickle the keyboard and let the Maslow do that part.
 I'm looking forward to the time in the near future when we can accurately cut some full-sheet layouts like these.

Thanks for sharing that!, Keep the cuts in the lower .75 of the sheet to avoid distortions to the cuts.

@rollanddelliott, plain but joints with screws are weak and have a tendency to work loose over time.. getting everything straight is also a real pain.

having a CNC cut the pieces, cut slots, possibly even drill screw holes in just the right places, results in something that's much easier to assemble and much stronger once it's assembled.
