## Front arms issue

I suggest changing the maslow's front arms.  The arms go to a sharp point, in plywood it just chips out.  it's also a weakpoint that is easily damaged during building of the maslow.  Change the point to say a 1" radius.

Great suggestion! Will you make an issue for it on GitHub so I wont forget?
