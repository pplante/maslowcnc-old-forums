## Should the first part to be cut be the sled?
Posted on **2017-05-02 22:57:01** by **mcginniwa**:

In the notes on [Using the Temporary Frame to Cut Parts Step 15](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Using-the-Temporary-Frame-to-Cut-Parts#step-15-repeat) it mentions the temp sled having problems while cutting due to dipping into previous cuts.



I wonder if a simple solution is that the first part to be cut is the final sled. Then it is assembled to replace the temporary sled and used for the remaining cutting of the final frame parts.



Thoughts?

That sounds like a good plan. I haven't cut yet, but my plan is to cut the sled and the arms first, all from as near the middle of the work area as I can get. I think those parts want the most accuracy, and it seems accuracy is best near the middle of the work area.

I committed to cutting all the parts using the temp sled without the z-axis because I wanted to make sure it was possible.



Cutting the real sled first makes a lot of sense.

> The downside of cutting the final sled then using it to cut remaining parts is that it adds another round of measuring and calibration on the temp frame.



Meant to post that to this thread. Putting it here for others future reference.
