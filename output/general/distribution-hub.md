I had asked this on kickstarter, do you have any plans for a European distribution centre to save your eu backers import charges?
It's looking like an extra â‚¬100 in duty to Ireland.

I would not expect them to do so. all the manufacturing of parts is done in the US, and all the people on the team are in the US.

Once they satisfy the kickstarter, I hope they make a kit of just the custom/hard to get things (motors, custom circuit boards) to make it easy for people to make their own custom version.

I've actually been thinking about exactly that but I wouldn't put it in the "plans" category. I have some friends in Ireland and I would like to look into the legality of having them ship to the EU to keep the import charges down. 

I'm sure it's more complicated than me shipping things to them and them shipping them to you, but I'm not sure in what ways. 

It is something I am interested in, but I don't think it will happen in time for the kickstarter. If you know anything about how those import taxes work, I'd love to learn more.
