## recommended router bits
Posted on **2017-03-30 17:53:46** by **travelbug007**:

Bar/Hannah, 

Would you consider supplying/offering (a) or a few router bits that you recommend. I haven't been able to find a decent source for a thin bit, and figured you may be able to source them easier or cost effectively in qty. Alternatively, can you recommend an online source? My local HD doesn't seem to carry any bits that would work well for the Maslow application. 

Thx! 

Martin.

Sure thing. I haven't tested all of the bit options out there, so I'd love to hear what other people are using too. I've been doing most of my cutting with [these](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Diablo-1-4-in-Up-Spiral-Router-Bit-DR75101/204073552) quarter inch carbide up-spiral bits. I bet you could find them cheaper, but these are available at the store down the street :-)

I'm running these right now, and they seem to be doing well.  Sure are affordable.
