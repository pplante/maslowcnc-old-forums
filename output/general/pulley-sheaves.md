## Pulley Sheaves
Posted on **2017-04-07 13:25:32** by **scottsm**:

I'm having trouble keeping the stretchy string on the sheaves, in particular the ones on the cup hooks. I've had to pick the sheaves up off the floor a few times, and one of the sheaves has lost its inner race. While they're elegant in their simplicity and they make it very easy to thread the string, I'll probably look for replacements. Is there any reason that a simple pin-shaft wouldn't work as well as the ball bearing shaft?

I've noticed the same thing. That top one IS especially frustrating and I've removed it from the final design. I also found the one on the S-hook frustrating and removed it too. In the future the string system will use only one pulley on the bottom hook. To get the same tension, the string is doubled up.

The path I'm experimenting with is *Top Hook -> Pulley on Bottom Hook -> Attached to S-Hook*

It is simpler. I haven't tested it enough to be sure yet, but I think it works just as well. I would attach pictures but we're having city building inspectors come today so I can't go in the building :( . There is no need to cut the string if you want to test it, just hook both ends on the top hook and snag the bottom of the U created on the S hook.

I think a pin-shaft would work just as well as the bearing.
