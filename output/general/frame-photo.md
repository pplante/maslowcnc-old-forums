I'm almost finished with the frame. I've ordered a set of locking caster wheels to mount it off the ground. I didn't see a finished pic of the motor and chain mounting location, so I took a guess. No issues with the chains binding when traveling through the hole thus far.

I was experimenting with graphics on the arms. 50in/min and .20 depth was to fast for the detail. ;) [Image](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:JHnX:image.jpeg.jpg) [Image-1](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:Bajj:file_1image.jpeg.jpg) [Image-2](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:oFoI:file_2image.jpeg.jpg)

Those are pretty damn awesome first cuts!! The letters have some overshoot at the turns which could be hardware or firmware. The wobbles in the curves could be related to overshoot, as the machine is essentially making many tiny straight lines. That's why I wrote up those two previous posts about testing with squares not circles, and testing basic functionality with manually created g-code. The imperfect z depths are a different issue, maybe backlash in the worm gear. Awesome start. :)

wow that is an awesome setup. I would be very interested in a close up of your motor mounts.
