## Arms Construction
Posted on **2017-03-27 10:29:38** by **mattnelson**:

I'm wanting to start building the arms even though I'm not part of the beta group.  I'm got them cut out, but was wondering about assembly.  Is it ok to glue the arms front and back panels together?  I can later add the screws when I get my kit.  I want to glue them now, router the edges, then put on a coat of polyurathane.

whatever holds everything together :-)

I guess I'm also asking it these ever need to be separated from each other during construction?  Is there any reason I should not permanently attach them together?

Nope, once they go together, you shouldn't have to separate them again. Being able to remove the complete arms from the body of the machine is nice for moving it if you need to, but the arms themselves stay as a single unit.

I was wanting to build arms while waiting for my kit(to skip the step of a temporary frame).  Are there dxf or stl files for the arms?   Failing that, even a PDF with dimensions of arms and would be a huge help in the Mechanical section.

Yes there are SVG files of the arms.  Look under the Source section of this website, then under Mechanical.

Hi Matt, thanks for the pictures. Glad someone else had the same idea... (Cloudconvert was able to make the conversion from SVG to CAD - to save the legwork for anyone else reading this... ) It appears to me it was designed in inches.  Just to cross-check our work to ensure correct scaling, did you get 4.72 inches for motor baseplate slot width, 7.55 inches for y-axis mount surface, 14.5 inches for x-axis mount surface? (Mount surface dimensions exclude radius of central circular contour)  Let me know, Thanks.
