## Noticed the new picts in the frame assembly wiki

I love all the work you guys have done, here are a few friendly suggestions.  In this pict https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/raw/master/Documentation/Assembling%20The%20Final%20Frame/Add%20Chain.jpg I noticed the screws go through the motor mounting piece, this seems dangerous and doesn't look professional.  Also, the new arms should be modified to fully cover the 2x4, it doesn't look great having the 2x4 protruding through from behind the arm.  I also suggest where the arms meet the plywood and it goes to a sharp point be rounded slightly.

I suspect that most people won't bother with the plywood parts of the arms as they are purely cosmetic.

The screws are an issue, but I'd bet that these are the smallest ones they stocked for the kit, possibly putting a second layer of plywood on the bottom of the motor mount will solve this (and if it's shaped to match the top part, just shorter, it also will serve as a guide to mounting it straight.

I noticed that the front plywood for the arm has a dogbone in it to handle the sharp edge of the mount. But the dogbone is done my cutting 1/2 the bit diameter continuing the short edge. If you instead cut diagonally away from both edges, you only have to cut .115 times your diameter ((1-sqrt(2)/2)  x radius) since .115 is harder to keep track of, think that you only have to cut 1/4 the bit radius instead of the full radius to make room for the corner.

I think the plywood parts of the arms will provide meaningful support against twisting of the motor mounts And will help to assure that the arms are properly positioned. As for the asthetics, there is much room for individuality :)

Great recommendations!

@davidlang is regrettably correct, we just shipped two sizes in the box so we're a little stuck. We could add a note recommending using shorter screws if people have them, oraybe add a second layer of plywood? We will add some which are shorter in the future.

Rounding off the point corners is a great idea, and I've made that change to the model. I'll need to regenerate the .Svg files.

I agree that having the 2x4 showing is not asthetically pleasing, but I tried it with a square end and I thought it was uglier that way. Do you think it would be reasonable to ask people to cut off the 2x4 corner? 

@scottsm is right that the real goal of the arm covers is to ensure that the arms end up symetical. I've tried to design the frame with as little measuring as possible :-)

I understand about the screws, like you say, shipping shorter screws in the future is probably the best solution.  I agree that squaring off the end of the arms wouldn't look good either, perhaps an overly large rounded end, a curve that easily covers the 2x4?  I wouldn't ask people to cut off the 2x4 corner as that introduces another tool.

Also, did the machine get taller?  Do these arms keep the original distance between the motors, and same overall height?  Will it fit through a standard 6'7" doorway?

These parts are small enough that it would be easy to cut a second layer to handle the screw length (possibly two options, one if you are using the arm cover, one if you aren't)

Great question about the door! I haven't tested that, but it's an important question. I don't believe that it got significantly larger. I did tweak some dimensions to make all the numbers come out to rounder numbers to make cutting the 2x4 lengths simpler, so it may have changed size somewhat, but I don't think it was a significant amount
