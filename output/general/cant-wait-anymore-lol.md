I'm curious about how shipping is looking?  Are you guys still waiting on parts or is it just a matter of not wanting to rush the beta process as you mentioned earlier?  I'd rather receive mine earlier knowing their were still issues to work out than havibg to wait until it is near perfect.  Perhaps a second round of beta for those ok with a few bugs still in the system?

Hey Matt, see my post below for details. It's not a price increase as roll described, but rather a premium for getting it as soon as this week. I was willing to pay $550 originally to get it first. Open to offers as well.

I've already paid for my order, I'm in the first non-beta batch.  Don't want to order a second one.  Thanks though.

We are still waiting on the arduino shields to get put together. I wish we could start shipping right away :-)
