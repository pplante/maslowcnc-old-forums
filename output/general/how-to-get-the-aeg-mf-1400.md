Or does anyone have other 220V router suggestions with similar features (I can do without the vacuum pipe, if need be)

The Bosch GOF 1600 CE is used by @mcginniwa and Bosch GOF 2000 CE is used by me.

With the Bosch GOF 1600 CE, you'll need to order the fixed base part separately from the [US Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bosch-MRF01-Router-Fixed-Routers/dp/B00AEBXH7S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1489880973&sr=8-1&keywords=bosch+fixed+base).

Getting it working with the Z-axis kit is still a work-in-progress for the Bosch GOF 1600 CE. So be warned it's not a sure thing until you hear otherwise.

Gero, for the gof 2000 ce, what is the suitable shaft connector size? Do you know of any website that would ship to Indonesia?

And also, would connecting the z-axis need extra tinkering and customizations?
