Hi guys,

I am looking at ordering a Maslow but thought id ask those that already have one.

If I made the frame from steel and attached a plasma cutter torch to the sled would this be a feasible build?

How hard would it be to get the Maslow to controll the trigger on the torch so that it can start and stop the plasma cutter?

any other thoughts?

You are far from the first person to think of this, nobody has reported back yet on building such a version.



the maslow software does not turn the router on and off, Bar is afraid of the liability of adding that, but it would be a fairly trivial modification of the software to do so.

could the Z axis part of the software be used to turn the plasma cutter on/off?

when you start cutting metal it gets a lot more complicated even 1/8 steel sheet will weigh 150 lbs. how are you going to get that on the frame? I have a plasma cutter, typically just send stuff out to get laser cut it's so cheap now a days

deffinetely would be cool to see a plasma maslow though.

yeah moving the sheet around can be a hassle, but i should be able to move it with a forklift, even if I have to buy a sheet metal jaws.

I have recently got a bunch of stuff laser cut and while it is cleaner edges it cost me $300. it was 3mm sheet.
