## Need a new chain or at least part of one

what are the chain specs mine uhmm.. slipped caught then mangled need to go get a new segment the chain bent and now pops off when those links reach the teeth.

Actually I did think of a way. I believe the initial bend occurred during chain measuring so far that seems to be the part of the process that is a little too tricky. The chains are so loose at that point I bet many have had to do it a number of times. couldn't you change the routine so you eyeball the chain to the temp sled  more or less center. Then measure the  length of each side. I won't attempt to convince you of the math since your way more familiar with it than I will ever be

If I can find the chain locally I will just grab a box

Thanks for making it easy for us. If you have any trouble finding it, let us know.

Interesting that it happened while measuring out the chain. Measuring out the chain by hand was how the system worked originally, but I've been trying to move away from taking measurements by hand because it seems to give somewhat hit and miss results with regards to accuracy. 

Did it happen because the chain became twisted or wound up around the sprocket? Or do you think it was just the act of hanging loose that caused the issue?

yes wound up around sprocket about 1/3 of the way out happend to fast for me to really see I should have kept my finger on it then I thought hmm that is probably not a safe thing to ask someone to do

Maybe if the motors are in an standard place you could measure a location on the surface place the end here then loop back over the sprocket

Ok, yeah I was worried about that happening. I set them to feed out pretty slowly in the hopes that they wouldn't bind up at a lower speed, but that's clearly not enough. I still really think that the having the motors measure out the correct chain length is going to give much more accurate results, everyone (me included) keeps getting oval shaped circles when measuring by hand, but we need to find a safe way to do it. 

It seems like chain skipping/binding is one of the bigger issues we're going to need to take care of. I'm open to any and all suggestions.

I used a paint pen to mark the chain so I did not have to keep measuring.

as a place to get chain http://www.surpluscenter.com/Roller-Chain-Links/ANSI-Roller-Chain-Links/Roller-Chain/?page_no=1&fq=ATR_PowerTransPitch:25

has a 10' length of type 25 chain for $15 (as well as all the fittings, etc)

when feeding out the chain, put a string through the end link, and put a little tension on the string, that will keep it from wraping around the sprocket and keep your fingers clear.

I used a paint pen to mark the chain as well, but I still had to run the chain measurement after I had a skip. I've used one of the hairpin clips and some stretchy string to manage the chain end after a few inches of it are paid out from the sprocket.

what about the same idea as setting the z axis. put a center line on the work area and measure out a 1' 2' 3' cross along the center then use ground control to "sneak up on those intersections" 
I really like the marker paint Idea

I'm going to add a button which you can click when the machine is in the center to reset the chain lengths. I'm still a little worried about the repeatability of doing it by hand. Let's investigate! I've made an issue [here](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/issues/181)

I like the idea of this second way of setting the center. Can we have both? Maybe we don't need both?

I think ultimately we should just pick the better one, but until we decide which one is better, lets have both!
