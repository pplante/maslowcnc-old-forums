## Updated instructions
Posted on *2017-03-30 19:46:04* by *Bar*

We've been getting feedback that finishing the assembly instructions is a priority so I've re-written step 4 of the assembly guide to add some little feet on the bottom (credit to @blsteinhauer88 for that improvement to the process). 

I've also written steps 5 and 6 almost from scratch. I'm going to be going back through and following my own instructions to try to make them clearer, but if anyone else was willing to take a look and see what's confusing, I would love your feedback.

Step 6 in particular might be worth giving a read even if your machine is already together because it goes over some of the calibration procedures that are new to this week's software.

As always, you can find them at http://www.maslowcnc.com/assemblyguide .

Thanks everyone!

A note about which motor plugs into which port on the controller would be good.  Mine ran backwards!

Jumping ahead what are tree u bolts for?

The u-bolts will hold the motor mount to the arms.  You can catch a glimpse at 0:50 of this video:  https://youtu.be/Q-KCZoxvzcQ?t=58s
