## Bit frustrated
Posted on *2017-03-30 17:14:20* by *ledsled71*

I'm getting a bit frustrated, but figured I'd reach out to the community to figure out what I'm missing.

The lack of complete instructions has me at a standstill, but I'm thinking that there must be something pu out there that's helped a few of you get to the cutting steps.  

Are the resources to show me

1.'. How the chains attach to the temp sled
2. Where to get the files for the upper arms
3. How the arms are attached to the frame
4. Anything else I need to get this thing cutting?

I didn't realize that being a beta tester involved figuring out assembly as you went.  Any help is greatly appreciated!

Thank you for reaching out. We decided on the schedule based on shipping as soon as humanly possible with the knowledge that we would be able to move much faster and do a better job with your feedback. It's working, the community feedback is letting me to move much faster than I ever could have alone, but I understand how it's frustrating. 

The best thing I think I can do to make it less frustrating is to work on what you are asking for, and do it as quickly as possible. Most of last week, that was software fixes, but right now that's getting the instructions done. I just finished cleaning up and finishing the [how to assemble the temporary frame] in the last hour, and I'll have a first sold pass on the "How to build the temporary sled" instructions in the next hour.

To answer your questions: 

1) The cotter pins attach with a  [cotter pin](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:2Ty0:cotterpin.jpg.jpg) 
2) All of the files are available from the mechanics [GitHub page](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/tree/master/SVG%20Files)
3) The arms are attached to the frame with wood screws. Each arm comes in a front and  back half. The front half rests in the corner of the plywood sheet, the back half extends behind the plywood sheet and is attached with screws. Here is an "x-ray" view of the sketchup model  [Transparent arm](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:kzNp:transparentarm.jpg.jpg) 
4) If you need anything, let me know and I'll do my best.

Thanks for bearing with us. Your feedback about how we can make the process less frustrating is always always always more than welcome.

I've got the instructions re-written for step four of the assembly guide based on everyone's feedback and I've written steps five and six more or less from scratch to show some of the new software features. I'm gong to go back through and follow my own directions to see what's confusing when following the directions. Any feedback you have about how what's confusing, or how I can make the process smoother would fantastic.
