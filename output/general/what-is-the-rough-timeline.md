## What is the rough timeline for kits bought right after the kickstarter?
Posted on **2017-07-05 18:03:56** by **jeebiss**:

I paid $1 to reserve a spot to buy a kit at the kickstarter price a couple months ago. I know that the first round of kits just started flying out recently. Is there any information on a timeline (even just a rough estimate) of when the list I got on will start to ship? More importantly, I just want to make sure I get the full amount paid as soon as the option is available. Im hoping that within a month or two I may see my kit!



Any updates would be appreciated!

Hey jeebiss, we opened sales again just for you guys a few weeks ago and then closed them pretty quickly because we were getting overwhelmed. You should have gotten an email letting you know sales were open, but if not shoot an email to hannah@maslowcnc.com and we'll get things straightened out. Forgive her if it takes a couple days to hear back. Shes coordinating shipping all our kickstarter orders this week and I think 'overwhelmed' would be an understatement this week :-)

Sorry off topic  not off topic. How come you guys don't have PayPal as a payment option? I wanted to get on the waiting list, and still do. There's just no PayPal option. :(

Back to the topic, what is the time line for those kits bought after the kickstarter if the kickstarter backers should be shipped by the end of the week?

Fun story :-) 



We did have paypal for about a week, but then paypal called us and said that for part of paypal's terms of service are that the thing paid for with paypal have to ship within 30 days :-(

@spyker we're still on track for shipping the kits bought after the kickstarter around the end of summer

@Bar Yes I can see how that would be an issue. That leads me to ask. Do you for see point at which ships within 30 days would be a reality? Thank you for such a speedy reply.



I mean I'll go get a prepaid credit card if i have to ( I just don't like tieing anything to a bank account. They can't steal money they don't have access to is my online spending mantra )

Wait @Bar to Keep Paypal all you have to do is print out a shipping label and mail a letter to the person making the Reservation. They aren't paying for the Maslow. They are just making a Reservation to Purchase a Maslow. As long as they are actually shipped a Reservation within 30 days it's all good.

That seems a little shady :-), I bet we can work something out which doesn't require you to get a prepaid credit card. Would you be willing to mail a check or is that in the same category?

You can always accept (international) wire transfers ;). For one, accepting payments for more kits will help you to fund new resources and maybe hire more hands to get everything quicker.

I'm REALLY exited of getting my kit (I couldn't pay for the kickstarter at the time). I've got everything on my shop to build it myself, except the arduino shield. Is there any open source (hardware) schematic for it?

The schematic and layout are [on github](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Electronics) in eagle format. Look in the PowerDistribution folder. There is a .jpg of the schematic as well.

@Bar, Thank you for the reply on the AfterBacker timeline. Hopefully they ship well before September 21th, the last day of summer.

I might have missed the answer to the original question; so if you don't mind me asking again:

What is the approximate timeline for kit batches (Whether you bought from Kickstarter or from the website back in May)

---

Posted on **2017-07-12 19:17:34** by **Bar**:

Kickstarter batch #1 is all sent out, batch #2 is mostly sent out and will be completely sent out within maybe 10 days. Parts for the website orders are being manufactured right now and should arrive here in August, with the goal of shipping in September or October at the latest

Cool, thank you. We'll keep waiting. We've been excited since you showcased them on Tested. This whole project you guys are doing is exactly what us Average Joes need
