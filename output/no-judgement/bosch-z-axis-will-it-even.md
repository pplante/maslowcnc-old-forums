## Bosch z-axis, will it even work?
Posted on **2017-04-04 00:42:40** by **tntahan**:

So I have not gotten my Maslow yet (not one of the beta testers) and long story short I am moving so my router is in storage so I can't go look at it, but something just occurred to me.... I have a Bosch 1617 router and I ordered the z-axis for it. But on the fixed base, you are suppose to lock the router down once you make your micro adjustments or I think it will be too lose in the base to be accurate, but if it is locked, I don't think you can make micro adjustments, aka have the z motor can't do it's thing. Any of the beta testers using this router with the z-axis?  Or does anyone know if you can use the micro adjustment when it's locked down? Or how it does with not wobbling around without locking it down to the base?

check the part that locks it down, you should be able to fiddle with how tight it is and make it so that it's a stiff, but movable fit.

That's the point of the z-axis motor, to use the vertical thread adjustment. The latch is adjustable. When set to a very light touch, the router takes a deep breath, exhales, and slips easily in the base with -no- play.

It's pretty accurate. After all people have been using these routers for years and they work fine. The only difference with Maslow is the CNC/CAM.

The tab on the lever that fits into the sleeve, and those slots, are only a few 0.001" different. It's a slip fit.

The threaded rod is held firmly vertically by the C-clip.

The only slop is the backlash in the sliding bit threads. But that should have no effect on cuts that go all the way through a material. For precision depth cuts there -can- be a few 0.01" variation. I'm still thinking of a way to tighten that piece but it's not easy, may not be possible or may be ridiculously difficult/costly.

I have a Bosch GOF 1600 CE and the z axis works the same and works well manually, just worried about if the motor will fit above the coupler, not much space, maybe the shaft needs an extension. See my last post on 'Plunge based router' for some pics...

It'll be fine. The design style is very close to the RA1161 base. It's slightly updated such as the handles.

The diameter of the coupler is actually smaller than the adjustment knob on the router, so that fits.

The motor diameter isn't much larger. The output shaft is -offset- from center. Meaning the distance from the shaft to where it might bump into the router is -less- than the coupler. It'll be fine.
