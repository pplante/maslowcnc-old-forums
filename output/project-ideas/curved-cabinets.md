## Curved Cabinets
Posted on **2016-10-19 14:50:47** by **dbarnard**:

I'm really excited about this device! The Maker place near me closed down, so I have no access to CNC. I'm doing custom curved cabinetry for my vintage Airstream renovation, and the Maslow could be what makes the project happen. 



I need to make 3/8" tops, bottoms, and backer plates on these cabinets. The curves need to be precise, and I need to make a number of them, as I'll be laminating two layers of 3/8" ply together to form each piece. I've found that using two sheets of thin rather one sheet of thick means lots less waste, more strength and rigidity, and a greater tendency to stay flat.  Once I have the initial pieces cut, I'll screw in temporary 2X4s and fit the cabinet into the curves of the Airstream. This will be the strongback frame to wrap the sheets of 1/8" Eurolite ply around (6 oz. epoxy glass in between two layers) to form the actual shells.



Eighth-inch ply is a floppy mess, until you torment it into a curve. Then it's an ultra-light rigid structure!

Looks like an awesome project! I can't wait to see the real thing, but those renderings are so good I practically already can :-)

Retiring in a couple of years and buying an airstream is my dream so feel free to share some pictures and design ideas to keep the dream alive
