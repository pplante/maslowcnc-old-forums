## Deluxe Stand
Posted on **2017-03-25 08:00:47** by **jwolter0**:

As I mentioned in a previous post, I had planned to make my stand do double duty, as a plywood cart as well as supporting the Maslow.  Then bill_s's post prompted me to add rails for a panel saw.  Then I had the bright idea to use the back side for a whiteboard (for discussing build ideas with our students).  So with all that history, I present the deluxe Maslow CNC stand. 



A few notes:



1. I show the design with four swivel casters, but I would actually build it with two locking swivel casters and two "fixed" casters.  Swivel casters were what I found in the 3D warehouse.



2. The top and bottom rails are 1-5/8" Unistrut which will support the panel saw option as well as various clamping options, if needed.  As drawn right now, the top rail interferes with the ears.  My plan is to move it back slightly so it supports the ears, like in jknox's design.  



I'm happy to share my Sketchup file with the community.  Via the GitHub, perhaps?

That's a whole lot of utility in a small space. Awesome design!



Thanks for sharing it. I've been playing around with the idea of creating a GitHub repository just for us to all share designs. @theriflesspiral came up with the name "the community garden" which I like quite a bit. If I created that space would you add this as the first design?

I'd be honored.  Could you send me a link?  I'm not finding it under https://github.com/MaslowCNC, which suggests I'm looking in the wrong place.

I don't think unistrut for the bottom rail is a great idea, you don't want metal that close to the edge of the wood (it's better to cut the bottom rail a bit than to have the router hit metal like that)

@davidlang, good point.  Maybe move the unistrut down 3-1/2" and put a 1x4 on it to support the workpiece.  The good news is that the Unistrut, being thicker than the wood, will probably cause the sled to hang up long before the bit gets close to the metal.  I knew when I posted this that it would be subject to a few revisions.

You are probably looking in the right place, I just haven't  made it yet. Give me a couple hours to get the repository set up, I'll post a link as soon as it's built

Oh, gotcha.  I missed the "If" at the start of your sentence.  Reading comprehension, !FTW.

Thanks for the idea, I think this is a great one.

Okay folks, the pull request has been made.  The Sketchup file I uploaded has the CNC plywood base moved outward 1.5" to keep the router from finding the Unistrut.  If you are cutting deep enough to cut into your base sheet *and* your router goes beyond the plywood edge, you could still hit the rail.  I suppose one could advance the base sheet even farther to make this unlikely event even more unlikely, but my feeling is that this is good enough.
