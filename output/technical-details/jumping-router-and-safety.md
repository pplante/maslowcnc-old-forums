## Jumping Router and Safety
Posted on **2016-10-14 17:24:11** by **3nz01**:

First off... congrats. I love the idea, I love the implementation and I can't wait for the kickstarter to go live! I am wondering if any though has been given to the safety of the concept. When the router eventually hit's a knot and jumps off the wood what happens? Is there any way to detect something like this and shut it down?

Thank you! Safety is super important. I've never seen the router come even close to jumping. The chains hold it very rigidly in place. Something I was worried about is what happens if someone sets the feedrate really high and the depth of cut really deep, so I tested that. What ended up happening was almost nothing. The cut was ugly as can be, but that was pretty much all. 



Over all I'd say the machine is a lot safer than using a router by hand or even in a router table. It's still a power tool, and it's important to treat it with the proper respect, but I've never seen it jump in any significant way
