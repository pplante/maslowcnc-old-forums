What is everyone using to create their own designs? I don't think ground control creates designs from scratch but converts designs go Maslow instructions correct?

I want to know what others recommend to go from idea to dxf file for a newbie.
Thx so much. Looking forward to hearing from you all.

Fusion360 works great, I also find myself using Adobe Illustrator.

Sketchup and Qcad are also mentioned at https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/wiki/CAD-(Computer-Aided-Design)-software-packages
Correct, no software -within- Maslow design or create anything.
Neither does Maslow convert the design file to the g-code that the control board accepts. See makercam.com for one example of that, and there are others. (They should get listed in the software page too.)

I will be using http://www.emachineshop.com which outputs to dxf and can be converted to svg used by maslow.

it's really good for 2d drawings, but 3d mating of pieces can be done if you think creatively and they have tons of good tutorials on youtube.
