## New sled design
Posted on **2017-03-28 19:03:18** by **blsteinhauer88**:

Saw an infomercial for furniture movers, anti-friction plates. Went to Fred Meyer and grab some, re-cut a sled with pockets, glued in the anti friction gliders, glides like butter on a hot skillet.  So far it has not caught on anything.  [IMG_0491](/images/x0/x0c5_img_0491.jpg.jpg)

Looks awesome! How much lower friction is it?

I could lift one of the chain brackets and let it go..it would rock back and forth several times until it stopped. Haven't measured horizontal pressure. If you are on sanded ply, it is like glass.

That is umhw plastic

One could buy a whole sheet to make the sled out of also sold as tape

What is diameter of final sled? So i can buy right size umhw ahead if tine?

---

Posted on **2017-03-31 07:19:03** by **rollandelliott**:

12x12" is too small i think

---

Posted on **2017-03-31 07:36:58** by **jknox**:

Can't remember the exact size at the moment but it's nearly 18" diameter.

Posted on **2017-03-31 07:53:05** by **tmaker**:

The diameter of the sled in the Sketchup file is 436 mm

there are plenty of size variations on Amazon. A quick search reveals many sizes and thicknesses. Unfortunately at 24"x24"x1/2" the prices start to get relatively high: 

https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dindustrial&field-keywords=UHMW+24x24



An alternative might be expanded PVC used for outdoor signage. The upsides are, lower cost, easy to cut/route, very slick, pretty easy to find locally (assuming there's a sign supply store somewhere. The downside, it's softer than UHMW. Another interesting property of it - with heat it can be moulded. So one could warm the sides and round the edges to make a sort of sled. 

Here's some on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/PVC-Foam-Board-Sheet-Celtec/dp/B00FN5XECS/ref=sr_1_6?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1491177863&sr=1-6&keywords=celtec+24x24+12mm

I've been using Melamine.  Pretty slick, available in a variety of thicknesses, easy to cut to any shape, and cheap

@larry, I don't think they would work well. lots of little feet that you have to try and adjust to the exact same height, and each one a potential edge to catch on the work...

---

Posted on **2017-04-03 02:21:37** by **larry357**:

I think I will give it a go, less surface area=less friction, also they all measure the same height and if there are enough of them and it is balanced it should work. They are rounded and the cuts are smaller, so don't think it would catch. Still only trying it will tell :)

Posted on **2017-04-03 06:01:28** by **ericleahy**:

I work with the expanded pvc foam quite a bit for work and there really is a great variance in how hard the outer skin is between the brands.  Celtec is actually pretty soft and being used in our application would probably gouge rather quickly.  Komotex has a really firm outer layer that is very durable, can almost take a hammer to it, but I have only seen it in 1/2" and larger from our supplier.   There are several other brands that I can't recall off the top of my head, but they are all way to soft for our application.

---

Posted on **2017-04-03 13:01:22** by **nathanmiller**:

@ericleahy Yes! Celtec does tend to be pretty soft (in that it can gouge or dent) but it is slick and easy to cut. I'm not familiar with Komotex but if it's shell is harder I think it would be a fantastic contender as a slick sled for the router. Some fab shops or suppliers may even have some remnants that could be purchased on the cheap.

Posted on **2017-04-03 17:02:33** by **rollandelliott**:

$37 for a piece of 1/2 x24x24 pvc on amazon is not a good deal IMHO. you can get a sheet of 1/8" thick UMHW for $25 shipped. UMHW is clearly superior , not sure why people are trying to use more expensive materials with higher friction, pvc isn't any more slick than a piece of vanished wood and it probably will wear out faster

---

Posted on **2017-04-03 20:27:54** by **nathanmiller**:

@rollandelliott That's kind of a troll-ish reply but I get your point. It is possible UMHW is superior. The fun thing about open source is we can experiment with a lot of different materials and designs. I'm excited to see how people will evolve the whole system over time.

---

Posted on **2017-04-04 09:35:57** by **rollandelliott**:

i'ts no fun wasting time on bad materials imho, if you want to try go for it, but dont' be surprised if it becomes I told you so.

---

Posted on **2017-04-04 11:38:37** by **blsteinhauer88**:

I can tell you that the 4 furniture moving sliders I used from Fred Meyer for 9 bucks is working great and has less friction that the wood on wood so far. :>

---

Posted on **2017-04-04 13:08:21** by **noexit**:

@larry357 I'd be worried that your feet would catch on cuts. That's the main reason that the sled is so big, rather than using the one that comes with the router.

---

Posted on **2017-04-04 14:09:23** by **nathanmiller**:

Experiment folks! Test. Fail. Fix. Improve! That's the beauty of open source.

---

Posted on **2017-04-04 16:25:58** by **davidlang**:

@nathanmiller

the other part of opensource is sharing failures and helping other people avoid problems you've already run into.



The furniture moving feet are the right type of plastic, and have rounded edges, and are relatively large, so they are far better than the screw-on feet which are a much softer plastic (and designed to grip rather than slide), have sharp edges, and are small.



You want the sled to be slick, so per the information above, PVC is not a good plastic to use, UHMW is the best by far, and the cutting board material is somewhere in between.



you want the contact surface to be large so that it can't fall into a hole that you have cut. How large it needs to be depends on what you are cutting and how large the resulting holes are. If you are just cutting lines with a 1/2" or smaller bit, you could probably get by with contact points that are 2" or so (think two lines that get cut close to each other so the material in between is loose), if you are cutting things that have larger openings, or recessed areas cut at partial depth, you could end up needing a  much larger contact area.



The furniture moving pads are available in a few different sizes, use the largest ones you can (and try to remove the soft rubber on their back so that you can get a predictable height)

I've recently started using this [1/8" UHMW sheet](https://www.amazon.com/UHMW-Sheet-Virgin-Natural-Thick/dp/B00FMY9CQW/ref=sr_1_11?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1491371447&sr=1-11&keywords=UHMW+24x24) on my plywood sled, held in place with this [carpet tape](/images/h7/h7de_img_0445.jpg.jpg). It was a bit of a tussle prying the previous 1/32" sheet off - that tape does stick!

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 06:19:29** by **blsteinhauer88**:

Let's see s picture of the sled!

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 07:55:58** by **mindeye**:

@scottsm How does it compare to what you were using previously?

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 08:40:34** by **scottsm**:

I was using a 11.5" x  15" UHMW flexible cutting board about 1/32" thick. The shape didn't match the round sled and there was no way to radius the edges so I worried about it catching. The new material seems slip-river, but I don't have a measurement to back that up. The motor cal numbers are much the same as with the thin sheet. If I was doing it again, I might look for UHMW with the rough surface, as I've heard that has lower friction but again, no real numbers to back that up.

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 08:44:36** by **blsteinhauer88**:

I just cut these using mine on some scrap even transitioning over the gap's and on the different wood I got some pretty precise cuts.  [Image](/images/7f/7fpb_image.jpg.jpg)

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 08:46:40** by **scottsm**:

If I posted a picture of the sled, you would see that I forgot that the hole for the router bit is not in the center of the sled, so the UHMW with its hole in the center is offset from the plywood  :( ...

Posted on **2017-04-07 08:47:47** by **blsteinhauer88**:

It's not a beauty contest !! Ha Ha, wanted to see how it compared to my furnature movers.... LOL

Posted on **2017-04-07 08:49:54** by **Bar**:

@blsteinhauer88 those are looking good! We're getting there. Great work.

Brooklynn wanted Mini Mouse...

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 09:01:25** by **scottsm**:

You're right of course. [Here](/images/nr/nrmd_file_0sled.jpg.jpg)'s mine. Note the hole in the top edge - I put a screw in the middle of the 2x4 holding the motors and I hang the sled there when I want to unhook the chains.

Your sled seems to do fine across the rough surface, and that's a complex cut! How long did it take? What feed rate did you use?

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 09:05:11** by **Bar**:

@scottsm That sled looks beautiful!

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 09:06:01** by **Bar**:

I like the idea of having a hole to hang it from. That probably makes connecting and disconnecting the chains easier too. Great idea.

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 09:06:09** by **Bar**:

I think I'll add one of those.

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 09:22:58** by **blsteinhauer88**:

The mini mouse took about an hour and a few minutes. Mini I just stuck into maker cam and use the default feedrates with step downs of .20

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 09:28:38** by **blsteinhauer88**:

Wow your sled looks great! Mine is at the top of the feed and it actually slides on just the four pads.

---

Posted on **2017-04-07 11:31:13** by **scottsm**:

If your sled cut those intricate figures riding over the odd-shaped pieces in the picture I think you've got a keeper. Thanks for sharing, I'm getting excited again!

Cutting boards are HDPE NOT UMHW , still slick but wears easier

---

Posted on **2017-04-08 16:25:26** by **gero**:

I am confused about this friction material thing. If I would put the chains in the 5th hole from bottom, I could (in theory) cut vertical running slow. Gravity is my big friend in this hanging design. Friction is the small one that I need to prevent my sled to act like a pendulum (thats only my guess). Creating a hovercraft floating over the workpiece will (in my opinion) not lead to faster movements (my target). From where I am now (vertical) I will add a little tilt to create just the amount of friction I like. All theory :-) because no movements till now. To be fair, I bought a cutting board because of this posts. Everything else is not available for me (does not ship to your country).

---

Posted on **2017-04-08 20:57:01** by **davidlang**:

@ghero, the 'stock' design has things tilted a fair bit (~15 degrees), we think that having everything closer to vertical will work better, but we haven't had anyone try it and report.



Having the chains too far out can cause alignment problems as the sled gets close to the motors.
