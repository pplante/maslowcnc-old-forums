## Router Bit
Posted on **2017-04-11 04:24:51** by **larry357**:

Which router bits should I get?
1) 1 2 or 3 flute
2) how long, ill be cutting mainly 12mm and 9mm plywood but also the 18mm for the frame
3) up cut?
4) 1/4 inch (6mm) width
5) flat, ball nose

To start of I will make chairs, large logo, doll house, but also a halftone cnc art piece üòÅ

2- flute, long enough to get through the workpiece (and if you make an extra thick sled, you may want a bit longer), 3/4 to 1" should be good.

up cut will pull sawdust out of the cut, but will cause more tearout.

if you are wanting to cut all the way through things, you want a flat nose so that you don't have to cut your backing material to get all the way through your workpiece.

As for diameter, Bar started off using 1/" bits, but as I understand it, is now using larger ones (3/8" or 1/2") you can use anything, but there are advantages and disadvantages to any size.

+1 for everything @davidlang said.

My go-to bit is a 1/4inch two flute carbide up spiral with a flat tip.

o.k cool thank you! You should add it to the wiki :) I did read up a bit, but so many options to start from :)

aliexpress.com has them for cheap and all of them I've used are great quality

Thanks for the post and the info. Made me read into it. The wiki is a great idea. From what I read, buy the collet for the shift size. Reducers are temporary but not a permanent solution. 12' is 12.7mm and you find comments that it works for 12mm, but don't do it. Bosch sells collets metric and imperial. I have 12mm collet and it's hard to find anything for that. Most EU shops don't ship outside Europe. A page with shops would be helpful.

that's a great summary, @bar, you should consider adding a link to it in the docs.

You guys don't have to wait for me! Everyone can edit the wiki :)

More like everyone SHOULD PLEASE edit the wiki. Bar's job is to push the 0 and 1 buttons. Everyone else push the abc buttons. This area is more for discussion of topics. Wiki is where facts, consensus, results and final answers are recorded. When I checked a few weeks ago this page was 400K long. And the search tool is miserable. The wiki is where users can find the distilled gist of what happens here.

And I just don't know everything! Maslow is pretty much a new concept in the world of CNC so at this point nobody really knows what all is possible. I made a wiki page [here](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Tested-Router-Bits-Guide) which a link to the bit I use most. If you've tried a different style of bit, let everyone know how it worked!
