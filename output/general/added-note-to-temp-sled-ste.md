## Added note to Temp Sled Step 9 - feedback?
Posted on **2017-04-30 21:03:03** by **mcginniwa**:

I'm currently working through assembling the temporary sled. I found that I had to drill holes that matched my router's base-plate mounting holes into the temporary sled.



Although [step 9](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Creating-The-Temporary-Sled#step-9-attach-your-router) mentions that you may have to adjust things for your particular router (i.e. get longer screws if necessary), it doesn't note  the requirement to drill anything.



Or it didn't. I edited the wiki with a note below the image about drilling holes.



I'm curious if this step is necessary for most people's routers. I'm guessing yes... and therefore this note may need to be added to the main text of the step. Thoughts?



Even though this could be done with a router with the right size bit, it does feel like most people with need a drill instead. So a drill is required maybe?

you should need to drill holes both for the router and to mount the chain brackets

@davidlang yep, those are in the template pdf. Cutting them with the router is described in steps 4 through 6.



These are additional holes that vary depending on router base-plate, I believe.

yes, there is no standard for the baseplate screws. Once you mark them you can probably drill them out with a router as well (you may need to use a washer if the baseplate screws are small)

Yep, that's the gist of my note in the wiki. I guess my question is whether it should stay in the note below the image or move up in the main description of the step.

This is a really good point.



I think we should just bite the bullet and list a drill as a required tool. You can put the kit together without it by drilling the holes with the router, but I'm guessing most people have a drill anyway and it makes more sense for them to use it.



What does everyone think?

Drilling with a router makes me queasy. I think it's safe to assume someone putting Maslow together will, in 99% of the cases,. Have a drill of some kind.

Yeah, saying a drill is required makes sense to me. Most people will have it already. Since it's so common it should be fairly easy to borrow.



We're also suggesting pilot holes, so that underlines the fact that a drill is useful during assembly.
