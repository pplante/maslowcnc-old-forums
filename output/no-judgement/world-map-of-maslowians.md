Without giving away to much privacy, is it possible to know where my nearest Maslow Beta-Tester and Backer neighbors are?

I created a wiki page for everyone to share their Maslow builds. Everyone can edit the page to add their machine if they wish to share. Please feel free to modify the format. https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/List-of-community-built-Maslow-CNCs

That's a cool wiki page! It will be cool to be able to see all the builds in one place

New Zealand was faster, but Bahrain was third :-)

I'm scared to edit it gang, I don't understand the format.

@rancher I messed up the router page on my first github edit and a friendly soul cleaned it up for me :-). I discovered later there is a View or Preview tab to look at the formating.

I will revisit it, I last looked at it when there was only one entry and I was sure I was gonna make a mess of the columns.  Preview, got it!  Thank you for that.
