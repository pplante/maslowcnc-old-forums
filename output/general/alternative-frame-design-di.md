## Alternative Frame Design Dimensions
Posted on *2017-07-17 12:50:31* by *brandonmc*

I'm going to use the alternative frame design found in the assembly guide. Does any one know the distance from the top of the backboard (MDF) to the bottom of 2x8x10 that the motors mount on?

12-18 inches, different people have built different sizes. 18 inches is probably better
