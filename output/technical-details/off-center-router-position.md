## Off center router position

If I incorrectly install the router off center or make my own sled which has different proportions,  will the software be able to handle that?

You, can enter the dimensions of your sled into the software and it will do all the calculations for you for any (reasonable) sled dimensions. 



Mounting the router off center shouldn't be a big issue because the offset will always be constant.  The machine will let you define a home position based on where the bit is so the first time you set the home position you will correct for the offset without noticing. If you are really off center it may mess with your calibration of the machine, but we can find a solution to that if it's an issue.



A couple people have asked about adding a pen which is off center from the router to allow for the machine to cut and label parts in one operation. I think that's an awesome idea which would require adding a software offset calculation so there may be a software option to set an offset as well.

Thank you. Was thinking of making an aluminum sled and possible problems that may arise. As well as all the things I could screw up along the way.  Your design seems to be robust enough even for people like me :)
