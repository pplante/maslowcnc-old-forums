## Another modified stand
Posted on **2017-03-21 13:11:45** by **jknox**:

I needed something to keep me busy today so I put together a model of the Maslow stand. I made a few changes along the way that I think will make it easier to assemble before the Maslow is operational (everything but the ears can be made with very basic tools). A couple areas should be stronger as well.  Still a work in progress:  [Stand](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:tp3P:stand.png.jpg)

Mind if I ask what you are designing it in? I plan to take a stab at it in Fusion 360.

Awesome!

@jknox mind if we feature your modified stand in our update/on our website? we're going to try to keep a running "log" of updates that are made/attempted so that we can see our progress!

I like that. It's very close to what I'd do if I were to build that style frame. I like the horizontal stud across the top to put the weight of the plywood more directly on the vertical studs, and the front stud being full length to the top.

The only thing I do differently is to reduce parts count. The a-frames have 8 2x4s plus -20- little plywood plates. On the middle and lower horizontal studs I'd make them go all the way from front to back. That reduces those parts to 12, and adds a little sturdiness. The 20 isn't a big deal if a 'temporary' Maslow cuts them all out but to do it by jigsaw they're annoyingly numerous. :)

---

Posted on **2017-03-21 19:30:04** by **jknox**:

@hannahteagle please use my design in any way you like. When it's more finished I plan to upload it all to GrabCAD.

---

Posted on **2017-03-22 07:48:15** by **jknox**:

@jbarchuk The horizontal studs do go all the way front to back (except for the 15 degree angle on the front). I considered leaving out the plates, at least on the back joints, but I figured that having the plates there will keep it more rigid, especially over time. You could probably leave most of them off for the initial setup and then let the machine cut the rest.

Would someone be able to tell me what the diameter of the sled is supposed to be. When I convert the STL files to DWG (using illustrator) the scale gets messed up.

---

Posted on **2017-03-22 07:59:29** by **jknox**:

I mean SVG, not STL....

---

Posted on **2017-03-22 08:14:54** by **Bar**:

I can tell you the dimensions when I get to work, but if you don't want to wait, you can find generated .Svg files for all of the parts [here] (https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics?files=1)

Thanks, I just noticed there is a sketchup file for the sled, I'll measure that!

---

Posted on **2017-03-22 08:37:43** by **jbarchuk**:

> @jknox

> I considered leaving out the plates,

I think those are -absolutely- required! Otherwise at the front and back the screws are driving only into the end grain which is extremely weak.

Your side plates also looked a little larger than the stock design which I liked. That was what made me mention the 'one plate instead of two' thing. The space between the plates is smaller than the plates themselves, so why not just fill it in.

Good point, temporary setup they're much less critical, so could be left off.

@jknox beautiful thanks so much!

Posted on **2017-03-22 10:55:05** by **lthomas987**:

One really nice thing about the 16 plates required from this stand is that they would be really easy to make on a miter saw.  So if you had access to one you could have a mostly final stand before you fired up your Maslow.  The 4 for the top are less easy but not really hard to do.

@hannahteagle Thanks for the kind words in the update yesterday but I'm not a beta tester, I'm not even a backer, I'm just someone who can't wait for the kits to be on sale! That said, I do have another small contribution today. I made a PDF that will print a template for a 8.5"x11" (paper sized) temporary sled. A picture is [here](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:DuAl:temporarysled.png.jpg), but it may be easier to print the PDF to the proper scale (select "actual size" in the Adobe Reader print window).

I posted on the grabcad, but the files easily uploaded to Fusion 360 by selecting assembly_maslow_frame.asm as the main assembly file. Great work! Now I can see what it will take to build it in a collapsable format on steel or aluminum studs!

I've been meaning to try Fusion 360, let me know how it goes. Can't wait to see your additions to the design!

@jknox wow!! sorry for mislabelling you! :) although those facts make your contributions even more awesome! i'll be sure to update your info on our website. also that new sled PDF looks great. I'm sure Bar will have fun giving it a go when he comes back tomorrow

---

Posted on **2017-03-23 13:27:02** by **spyker**:

I'm going to skip on the metal stud idea until I can physically evaluate it. I played with it for a bit, like replacing the angled "ears" with a corner cut 2x6 to give it more support with the possibility of not needing the plywood ears, but the mounting would still be a weak point. I'd like to have the ability to add an "apron" to the cutting surface to be able to get closer the the edges and still have sled support.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 06:43:44** by **jknox**:

I made another temporary sled template, but this one requires that you have access to a printer that has b-sized paper (11" x 17"). This larger template has enough room for the bricks to mount, and includes a template for the brick holder within it.  [Here's a picture](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:RtM6:temporarysledlarge.png.jpg), the PDF is on GrabCAD: [https://grabcad.com/library/maslow-cnc-stand-assembly-1](https://grabcad.com/library/maslow-cnc-stand-assembly-1)

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 07:27:36** by **Bar**:

Beautiful! I haven't been able to make a temporary sled design which fits on a single 8.5*11 sheet of paper and holds more than one brick. I want to do some tests to see if the temp sled can work without bricks at all.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 09:56:09** by **davidlang**:

I'll point out that if you use the letter size template to position the holes so that everything is being mounted in a known location, you can just cut the wood wider and align the bricks to the edge of the paper.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 12:17:00** by **jknox**:

I never really tried to fit the bricks on the 8.5x11 template, I think it should actually work: [Small Sled with Bricks](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s2/:maslowcnc:usxr:temporarysledsmall2.png.jpg). I've updated "Temporary Sled - Small.pdf" on GrabCAD.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 12:19:56** by **jknox**:

It might require rotating the router so the handles don't get in the way.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 12:27:26** by **davidlang**:

I wouldn't be comfortable grabbing the bricks that close to the ends, but it's easy to make the sled longer and move the anchors further out (or add a second set)



but I've been known to over-design things a time or ten :-)

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 12:30:46** by **Bar**:

Sleak! I've just given up on getting the bricks to fit entirely. It seems like no bricks is ok for as long as it takes to cut a first sled.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 12:39:02** by **davidlang**:

I wonder if the bricks could be eliminated if everything is steeper. I believe the bricks are about half the overall sled weight.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 12:52:30** by **Bar**:

I think that's an important thing to investigate!

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 12:57:35** by **spyker**:

@davidlang, it'd have to be a variable per router as they all have different weights and dimensions. Not saying that it's not possible, but I think each user may have to investigate it until we have a few proven setups.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 18:09:25** by **rexklein**:

About the bricks have you ever set them up as a pendulum. I do not not know if things would go terribly wrong or right but I was thinking about the inertia and balance of the weight. Right now its all in my head and I will play with the concept once I am running but I was curious if you had tried anything like that.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 21:14:03** by **davidlang**:

The whole sled acts as a pendulum. There is an entry for how far the center of gravity is between the chain endpoints. This allows the firmware to calculate how much the sled will tilt with different tension on the two chains.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 21:17:39** by **aalbinger**:

I keep picturing a 3rd motor/encoder on a lower corner with a sprocket on the other corner and a connecting loop of chain.  Then a bungee from the chain to the bottom of the sled and the code to make it follow the exact x position of the sled.  Likely too complex but your description of the pendulum action made this pop into my head.

---

Posted on **2017-03-24 21:35:05** by **davidlang**:

@aalbinger, bar actually tried that in one of his early prototypes and found that simple weight worked better.

---

Posted on **2017-03-25 07:47:13** by **jwolter0**:

Nice stand!  I particularly like that the ears get a little more support!  I don't know if that was a problem, per se, but I suspect that the extra stiffness won't hurt.

---

Posted on **2017-03-25 07:58:32** by **Bar**:

I did play around a little with mounting the bricks as a pendulum and I think there is more room to experiment there. 



I also played around with two more cables which went to the bottom left and right corners and which were tensioned by counter weights, but I found that there was too much friction in the gravity based system. I think two more motors at the bottom could work well, but it would double the complexity of the system.



I think there is a huge amount of room to try new things. Nobody has really done what we're doing before so the best way to do everything hasn't really been figured out yet!

---

Posted on **2017-03-25 12:17:27** by **davidlang**:

I'lllpoint out that bricks on a pendulum, or any downward pulling line is going to need a significant modification to the kinematics code. right now it is written to figure out the tilt of the sled based on gravity and the center of gravity being on a line perpendicular to the chain attachments. Having the forces on the sled being different is going to make that calculation invalid and a new one needed.



I think there's a lot of room for experimentation with the sled that can be done first

---

Posted on **2017-03-25 12:30:19** by **davidlang**:

ideas for sled experimentation:



sled layout:



what if the chain attachments were closer together



what if the chain attachments were extremely close together (top center) and the bricks are as low as possible (make the entire sled a pendulum)



what if the chain hooks were on the center of the sides instead of the top (in line with the router bit)



what if the chain hooks, the bricks, and the router were all lined up so that the center of gravity, and bit offsets are both zero



construction:



how well does a steeper angle work? how close to vertical can we get? (and how much does it help the sled move better)



as you reduce the weight on the sled, does a smaller sled work better



could you make the sled have an air pressure layer between it an the workpiece (think hovercraft). It would need to have a pressurized tube and small holes under it so that even if some holes are exposed (over prior cuts), the entire thing doesn't loose pressure

 

what difference does making the sled out of a piece of melamine help (shelf material, mdf + coating, available at the local home improvement 

store)



what difference does making the sled out of a plastic cutting board make



what difference does using higher quality plywood that can be sanded smooth make



what difference does waxing the sled make (especially when  combined with something sanded very smooth)



does it make a difference to make the sled out of hardwood instead of softwood (i.e. expensive plywood instead of cheap or glued together pieces of hardwood), especially when combined with sanding and waxing

---

Posted on **2017-03-25 14:19:57** by **scottsm**:

I'm experiment with a cutting board held in place by carpet tape. Haven't put enough miles on to be definitive, but it seems to be holding on and perhaps sliding more freely than the plywood of the sled.

Here's a thought - during the 'calibrate motors' sequence there are some numbers shown that seem to be measuring minimum effective force of each motor. Would this also give a hint about the relative friction of different sled surfaces, if the surface material was the only variable (test run from the same location in then workspace)? Slipperier would enable a lower minimum number?

Posted on **2017-03-25 15:18:25** by **jbarchuk**:

With all due respect to everyone in this conversation, and I mean that sincerely, let's drop all this pendulum and 'more weight' stuff. -None- of it will add -any- technical or performance value to the Maslow. The balance topic is already taken care of in the math. It can be refined but that's a different topic Done. Please stop! Move on!

OK so I'll explain, and attempt to -prove- this, at least in a theoretical sense.

Gravity (as related to mass) 'causes' weight.

Gravity is a constant. Except for going to a higher altitude it can't be varied or otherwise controlled.

The Deimos, Phobos, Bottomos fact is that FRICTION is the ENEMY. More friction will always cause more inaccuracy. Given that fact, since we can't vary gravity, more weight will -always- = more friction. Period. Anything that adds weight is a Bad Thing. Period.

The one thing we -can- work to reduce is friction.

There is a COMPROMISE between the angle of the frameboard (in a sense effectively 'increasing gravity'), and the ability of the router to do its job which is to accurately and reliably push the bit int o the wood and cut it.

I will explain that with two reductiones ad absurdum, which I find often helps understand how to determine the -compromise-. Or what -reasonable- paths to look at to help find the compromise.

At one extreme, let's assume the frameboard is vertical, the foot of the sled is vertical, and the chains carrying the sled are vertical. The router bit protrudes from the sled, touches the working material, and pushes the sled slightly away from the working material. For a moment let's assume that there's only one chain holding the router, vertically oriented, the router bit is removed, and the router hangs there. If the router is pushed from the side it swings back and forth barely touching the working material. It's nearly frictionless and since friction is the enemy this should work excellently. This should be -ideal- because the enemy is defeated!! Add a router bit, attach the two chains, turn on the router motor and what happens? Actually an upcut router bit might dig into the wood and hold it there for a fraction of a second. Then the vibrations and chatter will bounce the router away from the working material, which will swing away hung by the chains, fall back to the material, gouge it a little and bounce away. The system will oscillate between gouge-bounce, gouge-bounce. Basically useless. Fail. Cool.

Now the other extreme. The frameboard is positioned horizontally. The foot of the sled lies on the working material. The chains are attached to he sled and the motors, (Actually the router bit holds the router up in the air until it starts cutting but you get the idea.) Turn on the router. The bit digs into the wood but it doesn't bounce away the way it did in the 'zero friction' configuration. That's great! Now tell the GC to command the chains to move the router to cut a part. If the chains pull inward the router moves and the bit cuts material. That works fine till the cut needs to go in the opposite direction, away from the motors. The motors feed out chain, but the router doesn't move. (?&quest;) Well, gee, the weight of the router has caused too much friction such that the chain 'pushing' on the router can't overcome the friction. Unworkable. Fail. Cool. Actually this configuration -would- work if it had Bar's original 'four chains' setup! But that defeats the intent of not needing a 6'x10' space to cut a sheet of plywood. Bummer but doable.

There are a few variations on these ideas.

One is where with the frameboard is in a vertical orientation and the router/sled/chains have zero mass/weight. Turn on the router, the bit cuts into the wood, bounces out router out, but with no mass it keeps swinging away into space, held by the chains, till it wraps around the frame and hits the back of the machine. Fail. :(

Another is where in that same vertical orientation the router has a MASSIVE weight on the order of a few tons. With that the vibrations and chatter will -not- bounce the router away from the material. An upcut bit ought to have enough pull to hold the router into the material. It might even work, -but- the frame, motors and chains have to be as equally massively huge in scale with the massive router, and is simply not workable. Fail.

There are more variations but I know you're already tired of this foolishness. :)

Obviously these thought experiments are unreasonable and ridiculous and no one is goingto try any of them in real life.

My intents are two. One is to help folks -understand- the forces and physics involved, gravity and weight, and the impediment to those forces, which is the original enemy I mentioned, FRICTION. The second is to help folks think about and imagine what experiments and tests they need to do to find the optimal BALANCE of weight and frame angle, as related to router bits, cut speeds, working material and such. There are too many variables to have just One True Setup. Unlike traditional metal machining with lathes and mills and such where there are many-many books and references to be plowed through to find the right answer, this particular arrangement of tools and materials has never been done before. There will be many people doing somewhat similar things where data and results can be narrowed down to a -range- of possibilities. Bar has already done the basics of that work but his real job now is to keep going with the -software- that makes the whole machine sing and dance, not the hardware and specific applications. So everyone is gonna have to take the time, thought and effort to practice and experiment to the best configuration for -their- specific application.

The common denominators of everything I've written are that 1) friction is the primary enemy, and 2) more weight always equals more friction. So, to achieve less friction, the purest most basic Truth is to ALWAYS aim for LESS WEIGHT!! Never add weight. Remove is where possible. Aim for the -balance- between accuracy and reliability, and instability.

Good thoughts, jbarchuk.  I had thought about using ball rollers or omni wheels to cut the friction, although admittedly, you would need a lot of them to be sure that a previous cut wouldn't cause the sled to dip and increase your depth of cut.  That kind of solution might buy you some reduction in friction, although it would add cost, perhaps significantly.

---

Posted on **2017-03-25 15:55:41** by **davidlang**:

it's worth noting that the majority of the work being done isn't cutting down into the workpiece, it's cutting sidewise into the workpiece. As such, even a fully vertical workpiece wouldn't be as horrible as you are listing.



But there's a lot of room between the current 15 degree angle and vertical. I wouldn't be surprised to find that going t something like 5 degrees worked very well.

---

Posted on **2017-03-25 16:48:22** by **dantherugbyman**:

Hi all, bit late to the conversation, could the sled not be made from Perspex, to reduce the weight somewhat ?

---

Posted on **2017-03-25 16:56:59** by **davidlang**:

the weight of the sled isn't significant, the bricks are !4.5Kg each and the router is several Kg (I wasn't able to find anything other than the shipping weight of the full package at ~10Kg, I don't know how much of that is the router.



If just making things lighter was the solution, eliminating the bricks would cut the weight of the sled in half (or more)



the weight of the sled+router+bricks is a bad thing for the friction of the sled to the workpiece, but it's needed to keep enough tension on the chains for the positioning to work well.

---

Posted on **2017-03-25 17:08:08** by **dantherugbyman**:

Ok yes I see your point, the main weight is the bricks. Has it already been proven that the full weight of the bricks is required, would 2 half bricks work for example ?

> @davidlang

> it's worth noting that the majority of the work being done isn't cutting down into the workpiece, it's cutting sidewise into the workpiece.



Absolutely true. I described it that way to say that the 'vertical frame' can't even -begin- to make any other cut if it can't survive the first plunge. Or if it did survive that, then yes it might be able to cut vertically up or down, but the torque imparted by a horizontal cut would jump the bit out of the cut. Remember the early conversations where that was a major concern? That obviously wasn't true because Bar's and other machines work fine without jumping out of the cut, but at the extreme angle with no weight on the router then it immediately becomes a concern.

> As such, even a fully vertical workpiece wouldn't be as horrible as you are listing.

With no weight on it? We don't have more than passing info from Bar about early development. The bricks -are- there, and not for no reason. I'd bet even odds that with no bricks that the right kind of curved cut causes it to jump out regularly. He tried upwards of 6 br icks. That -can't- have been for no reason. He probably tried 4 and never got a jump, and the same at 2 so left it at that.

Related to the curves thing, and the the chain that skipped the tooth. He described it as a particular cut up in the corner of the board. It's the extreme situations where 'never had a problem before' changes to 'fails a lot.'

That skipped tooth thing is a very severe failure. Imagine that it happens during the first 10 minutes of a three hour cut, and no one's in the room to hear it. The part is done but looks.... odd?&quest;? That's a very nasty failure to try to troubleshoot when there's no lasting evidence that it happened except for the odd part.

> But there's a lot of room between the current 15 degree angle and vertical. I wouldn't be surprised to find that going t something like 5 degrees worked very well.

For sure, and more difficult materials that need to go shallower too. That's why I emphasised the 'test/experiment' thing to find the best setup for a particular situation. We're trying to set up baselines that 'should' work for many/most average situations but by the posts here there are tons of ppl already stepping outside the box. Those are the ppl that will have the most difficulty troubleshooting if they don't know the best path to follow to fix their malfunctions.

@dantherubyman

Bar found one combination of things that worked for him. As we expand the number of people using it, we find corner cases more easily



During this beta test period, we will learn more as more people experiment.



We don't know how well/poorly a steeper angle will work



We don't know what weight changes will do (especially if combined with steeper angles)



That's what the beta testers are going to be able to test :-)



Bar made sure that the mechanics/electronics were as solid as he could make them before shipping, but the wood parts did not get as much testing (their design can change after the hardware ships)



@jbarchuk, the sled would hardly be without weight, the sled and the router are a fair bit of weight, and the chains don't twist that easily, so I don't think the router would pull itself out of the workpiece on a horizontal cut. But I'm not advocating a vertical workpiece, I am asking those who are in the beta group (especially those who have  built hindged frames) to test with steeper angles and see how it improves/hurts things so that we can see if the general-purpose frame should be changed.

Worse than that, if a bunch of rollers fall in a very wide cut, more of them will snag up when they reach the other side of the cut and possible jam the whole system, break a motor mount, or bend a bracket. There's another post where someone broke a sled by pulling too hard and Bar says he's looking at a using the current sensors to stop the machine for those kinds of very bad situations.

Look to older technologies and techniques. They do what they do because things have worked for a long time. Skiers don't 'add' anything to the bottoms of their skis to go faster or turn sharper. The want clean, smooth and flat. The tips are curved up, and similarly the sled should be curved up all around the perimeter to help it ride over cuts and other working surface oddities.

Simpler is usually better.

> @davidlang

We're still talking about the vertical oriented frame, right? From a 5' height, a 0.5" long router bit pushing even a 15-20# combined weight or router, sled and chains wouldn't import more than a few ounces of force of the bit on the surface. Spin the router and it'd probably take a while to eventually grind (not cleanly cut) a hole into the material. At that point no it probably wouldn't jump out. But when the -angled- chain pulls that puts out a lateral force that only a few ounces is resisting it'd jump right out. Or maybe not jump cleanly but chatter around trying to jump. Regardless, it would be be a pretty sight.

> and the chains don't twist that easily,

Whether chain, clothesline or rigid bar I don't think it would make a difference as regards the jump. But I checked and a 5' length of chain rotates 180 deg with no effort at all.

> But I'm not advocating a vertical workpiece,

Of course not, nobody is. :) As I said these are all ridiculously absurd t hought experiments to help ppl think about, visualise and understand what's going on in different places at different times under different conditions. The better someone can 'dig it' the better they can set up tests, make sense the results, and report observations in a useful manner.

> I am asking those who are in the beta group (especially those who have built hindged frames) to test with steeper angles and see how it improves/hurts things so that we can see if the general-purpose frame should be changed.

A hinged frame isn't even necessary to fool around with angles. Slipping a piece of 1/8" wood under the front or back corners of the a-frames will make it shift 'a bunch'. (I can't do the trig to find out what the degrees of change would be for a given shim but when I need it I cheat and use onilne calculators. :))
