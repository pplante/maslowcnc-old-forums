at least I know the motors are strong enough to pull the temp-sled apart.

I was pressing the Home button repeatedly - it kept bringing the sled/router up - I guess I pressed one too many times. I had calibrated chain length.. 

I did not really know when it would be considered home enough..

They are pretty dang strong!

We can read how much force each motor is applying in the firmware, and I think ultimately we will need to put a limit in there which will stop the motors if they detect they are applying an excessive amount of force.

plywood is probably a bit stronger, but the motors are pulling at about 30Kg (66 pounds) of force, that's probably enough to bend the brackets over time.

Ouch!  So how are you supposed to know when home is home?

The maslow doesn't have any position sensors, so it boils down to what you define as home.
