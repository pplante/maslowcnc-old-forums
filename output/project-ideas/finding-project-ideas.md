## Finding Project Ideas?
Posted on **2016-10-27 16:22:11** by **sparhawk2k**:

Where do people look for project ideas? Pinterest obviously seems popular but are there public boards? Or just searching for different terms?



A lot of them also don't include files so I'd have to re-create them from the pictures which I'd rather not start with. Do people have favorite sites where the files are shared too? It seems to be much more common with smaller projects and 3D printing but maybe I'm just not looking in the right spot? I'm rather new to this.

I'm amazed by how much good stuff there is on pinterest! Unfortunately , like you said, they almost never have the files available so it's more of an inspiration thing than a source.



You are right that there is a LOT more out there for 3D printers and the like. I think that's because buying a 4*8 CNC normally costs $10,000 - $30,000 so there just aren't a lot of people out there yet using them and sharing, or at least not enough people to form a community. 



I'm hoping that as we try to push the cost of this kind of thing down, we can encourage more people to share.



There are a lot of one-off open source projects people have posted on their own sites, but I haven't really found a good resource like thingaverse for big CNC things yet.

You might check out the cnczone.com forums... especially this section has a lot of files sometimes:

I plan to use the Maslow to cut the panels for my boat designs: http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/walters/index.htm

I use ponoko a lot.  They are a laser cutting service.  However, they also allow people optionally upload files (something I've never done).  These are laser cutting files so they would need some modification and some won't work, but it's good for inspiration.  http://www.ponoko.com/showroom/product-plans/free
