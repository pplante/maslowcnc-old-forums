Does anyone have a legit frame design that does not require the maslow to build it?  I really don't want to build this bad boy twice.

I actually did cut the arms, but didn't use them, as I was concerned about flex throwing the accuracy off.

However,I did use the arms to approximate the location of the motors.  If I understand correctly, standard machine dimensions help with proper calibration
