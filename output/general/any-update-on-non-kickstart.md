## Any update on non kickstarter sales?
Posted on **2017-03-13 11:52:10** by **usetheforce**:

I was wondering if there was any update of the timeiine for sales after kickstarter? I found out about this too late. More wondering if I should try to build it myself or wait for the kit. Thanks

We haven't forgotten about you guys! The plan is to focus 100% on getting all of the beta testers up and cutting things and then see where we stand. We want to balance putting in orders for our longer lead time parts so we can ship as soon after our kickstarter orders as possible and at the same time make sure we have the time to handle all of our commitments to our backers. It's going to depend a lot on how we're feeling as the beta launch progresses, so we'll know more in the next few weeks.
