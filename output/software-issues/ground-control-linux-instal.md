## Ground Control Linux Install
Posted on **2017-07-10 11:42:24** by **jbnimble**:

In the [Linux install directions](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html) there are two options:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-kivy
```
or
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-kivy
```
Which version should we install for [Ground Control](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/wiki/Linux)?

I was hoping to use an Android tablet, but when I load a gcode file it hangs, so I guess there are some kinks to work out with Android and Ground Control.

You want python 2. Right now we're really only officially supporting windows/linux/mac, but if you get android to work, let me know because it's in the future
