What does this mean?  No more orders after these 220 kits?  The sky is falling?

We're just two people in a little taped off section of someone else's warehouse so we don't want to commit to more than we realistically think we can pack and ship on time. After they're all bought we won't sell anymore until we've got this batch done.

Is there a plan to supply parts and spares?

Yes. We're working on that right now. We're hoping to have the arduino shield and router bits for sale in the next few weeks. We're stocking up on all the parts, but we've got to find a way to make sure that everyone who already has the machine can get spare parts, but that people don't just buy a whole machine's worth of spare parts to skip waiting to buy a kit. The motors are the real issue because they're very expensive and take a long time to have made.

LOL I thought this was going to be a question about the mains voltage that the power supply will take...

This is why I shouldn't drink and internet.  Can we just pretend I was asking for a 220v kit?  I'm just over eager for my kit, I did get in on that first pre-order though!  I appreciate all the work and effort put in here.

Cheers @digital_janitor! I am posting sober, tipsy and wasted. This community is so forgiving that I don't hold back :-)
