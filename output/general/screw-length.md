## Screw length?

What length screws are used to attach the braces to the 2x4s?  The directions just say "short" wood screws.

The kit came with some 1.25" screws, that's what I'm using.

The 1.25 inch screws are the ones you want :-)

Thanks.  While I'm asking, how long are the "long" wood screws?  I want to start on my frame before my kit arrives.

really it just boils down to "longer screws hold better, but they can't be longer than the material they are holding is thick"

so if you are screwing together two 3/4" pieces of plywood, you better not be longer than 1.5" (and since plywood tends to be slightly undersized, and you frequently overdrive screws, 1.25" is the right answer)

If you are attaching 3/4" plywood to 1.5" 2x4, a 2" screw is about right. If you are attaching it to a 3.5" edge of a 2x4, you could go up to 4"

If you are connecting two 1.5" 2x4 to each other, you can't quite go to 3", and a 2" screw isn't going to hold well, so you should probably use a 2.5"

so the 'long screws' are probably 2.5", but the best answer really is "not quite long enough to poke through" :-)
