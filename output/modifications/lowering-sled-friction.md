## Lowering Sled Friction
Posted on *2017-04-24 04:58:11* by *jbnimble*

I've read different discussions here suggesting ways of lowering sled friction and many people suggested [UHMW sheets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CPRDLAW/ref=biss_dp_sa2), but I also saw this [UHMW Tape](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CL91NEY/ref=biss_dp_sa1) product that may also be an option.

Having something that is simple to re-apply and not too expensive seems like a nice solution in theory. Does anyone have insight whether the tape would work for lowering sled friction, and stand up to the abuse of the sled?

The thickness is what concerns me. 0.01" or 0.25mm might take damage if you go over cuts. With an upcut bit there are a few "needles'" pointing out.

for $7 for 15' of it, it's worth trying.

I bought some of the very thin stuff, had trouble with the corners snagging and coming up. Very slick, though.

Yes it works very well the trick to make it stick not rub off is to use double-sided foam tape underneath it this is because it he sieve used on the tape is not very aggressive if you supplement it with foam double-sided tape it works great

The plastics.com sells it in one 32nd fitness which is plenty second off UMHW is extremely abrasion resistant
