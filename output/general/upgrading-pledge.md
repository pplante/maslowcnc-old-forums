Hi there, I'm kinda a cautious kickstarter, since I've been burnt a few times.. but this one looks like delivering, the team have been great communicators... can I upgrade my pledge?

Hey Baradhili! 

Thanks for the support! 

You're already first in line to "upgrade" your pledge. :-) Our plan is to focus on delivering rewards to all of our kickstarter backers in the beta tier, tier one, and tier two before we accept any more orders. 

When we do begin accepting orders again we will ship them starting with our $1 kickstarter backers, moving on to the people who have paid $1 through our website, and finally opening up to the public. 

Our goal is to get machines to everyone who wants one, but we also need to make sure that we give ourselves the time to support the community we have. 

We promise, you'll be the first to know when we're ready to start taking more orders!
