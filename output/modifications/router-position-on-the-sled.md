## Router position on the sled
Posted on *2017-05-21 05:38:38* by *chadzimmerman*

Ok, I am wondering if the router position needs to be dead center. In working on my z axis design, to have the router dead center I am off the sled.

I am thinking that the z needs to be on the upper part of the sled. But no matter which side it goes, I will have to shift the center point. 

I may be able to adjust the z a bit once I get my roller bearings installed.

Why don't you just make a bigger sled so that the router can be that center that would be a lot easier I think

I already figured I may have to do a bit of redesign on the sled. But I don't want to make it overly large.

If the gantry could live at the bottom of the sled, it could nestle between the bricks, maybe? I don't think the bricks need to be radially aligned. They already stick out beyond the sled by quite a bit... .

Going to try both locations, this is all just theory at the moment :)

The router does not need to be dead center on the sled, the machine dimensions have an entry for the distance between a line connecting the chain pivot points and where the bit is, and a distance between hat point and where the center of gravity is.

making the bit be in the center of the sled is just an assumption that that gives the most protection against falling into an existing cut
