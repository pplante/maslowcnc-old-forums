## First projects...

Uh oh, I'm the first non-Maslow person posting.. must. avoid. "first!" comment.. dang, too late.



Anyway, I'm Bill, from the non-profit makerspace MakeIt Labs, in Nashua NH. We were fortunate enough to be voted as a recipient (thanks folks!) and are really looking forward to experimenting. I'm very curious to see what other folks' first projects are, and some of the things they want to experiment with most. Our own rough list looks something like this:



- Folding frame, because easy to store = more fun

- Combining a Maslow frame with other accessories (Panel saw track, etc) to maximize shop space value

- Good test/calibration projects, especially considering how many people we have in our shop, lots of new users who need to zero/test/experiment

- Good "first use" projects, beyond the basics of calibration. End tables? Signs? All sorts of options

- Experiences with different routers and bits/mills

- Z axis thoughts, because, well, Z-axis! :)

- Optimizing safety and dust collection (Operations/materials to avoid, E-stops, noise reduction, etc)

- Advanced project design to  best utilize the machine (eg order of operations for pieces with multiple Z depths, like routed inlay channels for contrasting wood, etc.)



If anyone's got similar thoughts, we'd love to collaborate. We have a full welding shop, plasma cutter and other "stuff" so folding frame experiments are both high on our list and easily do-able.



Looking forward to some fun...

Welcome!!!



Those all sound like awesome projects. We can't wait to see what you guys build :-)

We plan to put ours on casters for portability.  The first project will likely be the school logo to use as a paint template.

I really like your idea of adding a panel saw track...

John with FIRST Robotics Team 1248 from Berea-Midpark High School here.  We plan on building our frame on lockable casters with one side for the Maslow and one side for sheet goods storage.  Now that you mention a panel saw track, I'm rethinking th design to incorporate all three.  If anyone has design ideas, please share.

I am so stealing the idea of using the other side for sheet storage!
