## Cut out the frame
Posted on *2017-03-25 19:29:06* by *mattnelson*

I cut out the Maslow frame today at a local makerspace.  Used a $50 sheet of maple veneer.  Should be very pretty after I router the edges and polyurethane everything.   [IMG_91692](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:cnAI:img_91692.jpg.jpg)

That's cheating!  Just kidding, looks nice :)

I'm wondering if I could cut those out using the laser cutter at my local makerspace.  I love the look of laser-cut wood, with the wood grain on the flat surfaces, but laser char on the edges...  Now I have to go find out how thick a sheet of wood the laser cutters can take!

I really doubt you could laser cut it.  A 40 W laser maxes out at about 1/4"  You need a CNC router or water jet cutter.

those look good. someone should sell the parts premade IMHO. I'd buy them.  but your local makerspace might get annoyed if you sell stuff for a profit. I'd make the work surface 5x10' If I were you that way you can cut all the way to the left, right, and bottom edges, otherwise you loose about 20-30% of the material.

shipping of the parts would be the problem

No it wouldnt i ship parts that big via ups everyday

things that big and heavy? I'd expect the shipping to be more than the cost of the wood

people that buy things premade don't generally care what raw materials costs, they buy it for convenience. I know this is hard for DIY mindset to understand, but its true.

maker/builder/hacker/*space and profit are not mutually exclusive.
Are you a backer, independent builder, or fan?

Are you a backer, independent builder, or fan? Part of the intent of Maslow is that it -is- specifically -for- DIY people. If you don't have the skill to build the thing but want one prebuilt, put ads on craigslist for a local experienced carpenter and tech schoool kid. The carpenter prints the plans at the local office supply store, pastes it to a few sheets of wood, cuts it out by hand and screws it all together. The tech kid can assemble the electromechanical parts and get it connected to a PC. Or maybe you can find foth skill sets in one person. Naybe someone who has the skills and doean't know about Maslow, is inte restes and wants one, and can build two, one for each of you. As Bar said in I think the KS intro vid, Maslow can be built in a weekend. Basically one day's work with the both skills, or two half days for the two kinds of skills needed. After that you operate it. Done.
You'll need to learn maintenance such as cleaning, and software upgrades which will eventually be a click as simple as any other program. For problems, adjustments and repairs the forums are here, and you may need to call your carpenter and tech guy for anything you can't do.
In a sense Maslow is meant to be like any other home wood shop tool, except that it's pretty advanced. (Meaning that it's never been done before, that the pieces and parts aren't ground breaking, but the configuration is unique, unusual, and innovative.) It's a -simple- tool too in that it's not doing anything that can't be done by hand, it's just automated and more easily very accurate, and not that serious rocket science to build.
If the cost of shipping is worth it to you to have one, then another option is that of the machines you see here and like, write to the guy the built it and ask him to build one and send it to you.

Im a backer and fan 
Not going to buy anything precut till i get my unit
There are too many cool stand designs that might come out between now and then
Personally id rather spend my time using the machine not building it.  I can certainly make it though

Cool, then you can operate and maintain it easily. That was an option I didn't mention, ppl who want it now, and /or don't have the time or building interest, but want to make what -it- can make now. Similar to what I said tough, there aren't enough 'production level' machines built yet that can do it. Ahhh, I was mistaken about the electronics being easy though -- the motor/encoder I don't know whether is a production or custom part. Was it you or someone else talking about other motor/encoders that might work? And motor controllers? If not avail then can only wait til Bar can devote time and $ to another production run of them.

the motor/encoder is a custom part, they found that ordering a custom one was about the same price as separate components, and much easier for people to use.

motor controllers are a custom board, but electronically they should just be a set of h-bridges connected to the arduino
