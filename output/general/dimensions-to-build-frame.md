## Dimensions to build frame
Posted on **2017-05-04 07:29:31** by **tjennemann**:

So i am one of the lucky ones that will get to purchase this machine come May 15th. I use to help a cabinet company out with some designs so i am really looking forward to cutting my own work again. I have about 18yrs of Autocad experience so the partnership with Autodesk is going to be great.

My question is: 
   Is it possible to have an exact cut sheet of parts so that those of us that do have building background, This way i do not have to build a temporary frame first. I have read the website but without downloading anything yet i figured i would ask the question. Even if it is just a .dxf file that can be imported into autocad and used to pull dimensions. 

I would gladly help create this document if it hasn't already been done.

Thank you and look forward to really testing out this product. I already have the first design in the works.

Fantastic! Welcome!

We have a CAD model in SketchUp format as well as .Svg files which you could import into AutoCAD here: https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics

I would recommend using the green Download button in the upper right corner to download the whole folder, grabbing individual files seems to give mixed results.

We can't wait to see what you build!
