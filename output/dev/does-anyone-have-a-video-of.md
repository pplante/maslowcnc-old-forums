I could try to read the code and visualize it from there, but I think it would be useful to have a video to see what is supposed to be happening.

Excellent idea. Please add an Issue to the wiki. https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki That way it's on the record as a feature/project request, and doesn't get lost in the M00tie Shuffle. ;)
