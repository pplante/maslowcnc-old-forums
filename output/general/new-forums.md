## New Forums
Posted on *2017-07-17 14:28:19* by *Bar*

Last week it was pointed out by a number of our most active forums users, that the Muut system we have been using for forums is not well suited to our needs as the community grows and that it was time for a new forums. 

We heard you guys, and after much time trying to guess the password to access our DNS settings :-) I'm really excited to let everyone know that the new forums are up and running (mostly) over at http://forums.maslowcnc.com/

The new system is based on discourse.org and gives us a lot of the features we've been missing like the ability to make threads we don't want to get lost sticky or @ mentions that we use anyway, but which will actually notify us now.

Almost all of the content over at http://forums.maslowcnc.com/ right now is stuff that was auto-populated, but head on over there and claim your user name (or claim someone else's! I think I'm going to be @gero :-p from now on. Just kidding, don't actually do that :-) )

Let us know what you want to see, and let's settle into our new home!

I'm thinking about making the official move Wednesday with the update to give us some time to work out the kinks, is everyone OK with that?

Just wanted to bump this back to the top. I wish there was some sort of way to make this sticky :-)

Give it another try; other users are registering successfully... also, your error message says accesstype=offline which makes me think your connection dropped during the process.

I tried to register via github, but something went wrong, had to register manually.

@Bar the GitHub connection stuff [is here](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-github-login-for-discourse/13745). Let me know how I can help.

The Twitter, Google, and Facebook OAuth options don't seem to work for me either.  The other three look like they would work, but that is as far as I checked.

Good spot! I think I need to configure those on my end for them to work properly. Thanks for the head up, I'm on it!

Especially thanks for the link to exactly what to change @TheRiflesSpiral

I assume you'll include this in the weekly email, but you might want to make the swap after the next note?

Just a thought...

Logging in with GitHub is now working, and I've turned the others off until I can get them up and running

hmm... I should probably make my self a GitHub account but I hate extra accounts. I'm using Google to log in here. I would like to do the same for the new forum.
