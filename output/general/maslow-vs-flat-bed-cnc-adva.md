## Maslow vs flat bed cnc advantages/disadvantages?

Anyone own both? Besides cost and floor size what are advantages and disadvantages?

The MaslowCNC cost under $ 500.00 (no router) while a flat bed CNC that will cut the equivalent size is going to cost at least 4 times that amount (still with no router) . In the same space of a flat bed CNC that cuts the same size as the MaslowCNC you could have two MaslowCNC machines which would double the amount of work being done and still be cheaper then the flat bed CNC.

I would throw out that given the current accuracy and speed dynamics, you're likely able to move 2-4x faster on a flat bed CNC while attaining higher accuracy. I don't think that will remain to be the case though; just current state of the Maslow. I'm cheap and the Maslow finally let me get a CNC by offering it at such a low price point. For that, I'm very grateful. If I start to pull in enough money / volume building stuff with it then perhaps I'll look elsewhere but for now it's an amazing hobby.

It really is hard to compare as the flat bed CNC is a mature product while the MaslowCNC is in its infancy. I doubt that the MaslowCNC will ever get to the accuracy and speed of a flat bed CNC of the same cutting size. Like Mindeye, I am cheap so the MaslowCNC was in my price range.

I never really imagined Maslow competing with head to head with the big gantry machines like ShopBot on a performance basis. Those machines are beautiful and well worth the money they cost. Maslow's goal is to make CNC accessible so that everyone has a chance to learn about the CAD/CAM process and running a machine. As we continue to see the software and design improve we will get closer, but I always imagine it being a little bit of an apples and oranges comparison.
