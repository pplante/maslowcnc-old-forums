## CNC made Greenhouse
Posted on **2016-10-31 19:03:28** by **nathanmiller**:

Has anyone seen a good CNC cut greenhouse design? I've looked around but keep running across this wild thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bn2o-xyS6M

I'm looking out for a simpler, practical (as in grow vegetables style) greenhouse. Thoughts?

There's the Open Building Institute's greenhouse but it isn't expressly for CNC. Maybe marry it with the wiki house.

I've been dreaming about something inspired by one of these http://www.n55.dk/MANUALS/SPACEPLATESG/spaceplatesg.html . First person to build one share their design?

Hey Nathan: I saw something relevant to your greenhouse idea in an imgur album last night: imgur.com/gallery/ecVOZ



Check out the section where he CNC's the ribs for the ceiling in the bus; there's a really neat puzzle piece joint for the smaller pieces that reminded me of a greenhouse roof.

I've been thinking of building a greenhouse using the strategy in http://rigsomelight.com/2013/09/09/frameless-geodesic-dome.html but using the Maslow for cutting out different materials (plexiglas, polycarbonat, plywood) for the construction. It's a much simpler structure but it does put tension on the materials which they might not cope great with.

I've emailed N55 for some details on the SPACEPLATES project. Primarily, I'm trying to see if the original drawings for the Copenhagen greenhouse are available. I'll let you know if I get something out of that.

A video was posted yesterday with a guide to drawing the N55 spaceplates house in Sketchup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGlftltHCFo

All these designs look very cool, but if the goal is to grow vegetables, totally overkill and impractical. buy some 1x1 aluminum tube for 50 cents a foot, pound in tube nuts and use stainless steel bolts to connect it all together. add some cheap plastic over it and call it a day.

I think the target audience for these types of structures is in an area where those types of building materials are scarce and/or significantly more costly than $0.50/ft.

Aluminium is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust (after oxygen and silicon) and its the most abundant metal. Even shipped from an internet supplier it can be less than $1 a foot in quantities to make a small green house. 2x4's are an alternative and readily available as well. just because we can CNC materails doesn't mean it is the best solution especially for growing something as simple as veggies.

Perhaps not but this is a forum dedicated solely to the discussion of what could be made with a CNC and how it can be accomplished. You're going to spend a lot of keyboard time explaining to CNC nuts why they shouldn't CNC. ;)
