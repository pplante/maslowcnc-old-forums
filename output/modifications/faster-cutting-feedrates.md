Which modifications woud be the first you would do for cutting faster?

at the moment the feedrate limit is the firmware.



After that, the limit is going to be the motors, these only turn ~30 rpm, so you could get faster motors or put larger sprockets on them (the theoretical resolution available at 8148 encoder pulses per revolution is serious overkill :-)



but putting larger sprockets on the motors will decrease the amount of tension that can be put on the chain, that may make it hard to cut in the top-center of the workspace. If so, raising the arms a bit will help (you have an extra foot of chain, so you should be able to raise them a foot easily, beyond that you would need longer chains)
