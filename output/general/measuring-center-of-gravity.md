## Measuring center of gravity for temporary sled
Posted on *2017-04-30 23:34:36* by *mcginniwa*

Now I'm into the entering measurements into GroundControl section for the cutting of parts using the temporary frame.

First off, super rad work Hannah and Bar! So fun to see the temporary sled move when I hooked things up in GroundControl for the first time!

Now back to the funky area at hand. The steps generally are excellent. I'm just commenting on this to hopefully give valuable feedback for where things can be improved. If I knew how to clarify things, I would just edit the wiki, but this is just a little beyond me in this case.

Measuring center of gravity was a little tricky for the temporary sled as compared to the linked to video in [Step 4](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Using-the-Temporary-Frame-to-Cut-Parts#step-4-setup-machine-dimensions-video).

First, using the socket as a "rod" wasn't obvious to me in how it was described. A short cutaway shot of what was being described would be useful. I actually had to refer to the end of this [discussion](https://muut.com/i/maslowcnc/general:starter-sled) to figure it out.

The second issue I had was tha t with the temporary sled, my center of gravity was close enough to the router bit that the socket I was using as the roller would fall into the cutout around the bit. I had to use something wider than the cutout. I used a spray paint can as the roller in the end.

Ok, thanks for hearing me out. On to the next steps!

This feedback is EXCELLENT.

My plan for measuring the CG of the temporary sled was just to ignore it because without the bricks it's going to be so close to the router bit, and as you pointed out it's a little tough to measure. I've been thinking about the temporary sled as being just good enough to cut out the better parts.

How do you feel about that plan? If it's ok to ignore the CG value for the temporary sled, we should make that clear in the instructions.

Another option for measuring would be to use an angle iron on the ground and balancing the sled on that like a teeter-totter. Mark the pivot points and draw a line between them. Then turn the sled 90 degrees (it doesn't need to be precise) and balance it again. The intersection of the two balance lines will be the CG.

we are experimenting with less weight on the sled, we've got reports of it working well with half the bricks.

Let's get people to test with no bricks.

let's also test with the router directly inline between the chains.

This would significantly simplify the math

Sounds good to me.
