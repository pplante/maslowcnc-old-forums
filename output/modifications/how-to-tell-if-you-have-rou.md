## how to tell if you have router issues
Posted on **2016-11-16 13:09:17** by **davidlang**:

I was thinking of the router discussion and it occured to me that there isn't a good way for people to know if they are having problems with the router that they are using or not.

You are suggesting a 2HP, 1/2" router. This is a pretty beefy router.

If someone uses a 1/2 HP 1/4" trim router instead, how would they figure out that the router is causing them grief? And what should they adjust to fix them?

I think a video showing the different problems (perhaps with a simple rectangle cut test) would be very useful for people.

Issues I can think of offhand

1. the router is too light and more weight needs to be added to the sled

2. the router isn't cutting fast enough and you need to either get a more powerful router, slow down the cut speed, or make shallower cuts

3. cutting with a 1/4" bit instead of a 1/2" bit could end up with the bit clogging (the 1/2" bit cuts more, but proportionally has larger flutes to clear the material through)

4. move to fast and you could break a bit.

As with all power tools there is an inherent learning curve, every machine is different it doesn't matter if it's the same make and model or not, you have to experiment and learn what your setup is capable of.

The 1/8" cutters that Bar mentioned he was using should work in either the 1/4" or 1/2" router with reducing collets. My experience with them is that one must cut slowly, and resist the temptation to cut deep. I know when I've done wrong because the cutter breaks. I think there's a reason they sell them in 10-packs...  : ) The strength of the cutter seems a bigger factor than the power of the router. Travel speed, cut depth, rpm and the hardness of various materials will be interesting to share along with designs. I've got a lot to learn, anxious to start!

running a collet reducer to go from 1/2" to 1/8" is odd, and you don't need 2HP to spin a 1/8" bit. 1/8" bits are also very easy to break.

other large format wood CNC machines (shopbot, etc) routinely run 1/2" bits  Given that the recommended router is a 1/2" collet, I was expecting that to be the default cutting size.

The trouble with just saying "there's a learning curve" is that if you don't know what good and bad look like, it's really hard to learn and understand why things don't seem to be working well.

That's why I'm suggesting doing some videos of "not ideal" to show people what to look for.

something like this might be ideal..
