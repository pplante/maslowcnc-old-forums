I suspect that Bar and Hanna will be able to cancel/refund your order directly since they have opened up sales again.

@Hannah, wouldn't it be easier for everyone (and safer for oglesbay) for you to refund csmcvea's order and add it to the stock available for sale?

There's a waiting list for the maslows, so it's not that big a deal for them to do a refund and sell it to someone else (there's a little cost as kickstarter took a cut that they loose)
