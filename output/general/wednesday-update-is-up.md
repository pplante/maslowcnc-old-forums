just a note, if the engraving bit lets you fold the material to a 90 degree angle, you have a 90 degree v-bit, not a 45 degree bit. the measurement is between the two edges of the cut, not between one edge and the center.

I have been planning to offer to buy you a bit like https://www.amazon.com/Woodtek-Forming-Diameter-90-Degree-V-Groove/dp/B0084IUSBG/ref=sr_1_21?ie=UTF8&qid=1487680250&sr=8-21&keywords=v-groove+router+bit+1%2F2-inch+shank+90-degree that's a bit larger v-bit and should be able to cut a grove in up to 3/4" material.

I was thinking about the possibility to do a score-n-fold on plywood to create beams (stiffer, yet lighter than solid wood). I'd love to see some tests using a big bit like this around the bottom corners of the work area (and even outside the normal work area to see what happens as you are pushing the limits of the machine) but I haven't submitted a cut request yet as I hadn't worked out exactly what would be the best test (in part, the conflict between what's the best test and what results in something useful :-)

as for melting plastic, ir onically, being too tentitive is the biggest problem. As you are cutting, a lot of the heat is taken away with the chips, if you are doing too many passes, or using too slow a feed rate, you end up having more contact between the cutter and the material and powder being removed instead of shavings, and so less heat is taken away. Slow down the router motor, speed up the feed rate, and take deeper cuts (if you get too aggressive you eventually generate cracks, but I don't think you can slow the router enough to cause a problem.

with the double-sided tape, what did you use? there is a fairly thick double-sided tape with a foam center, and there is some very thin double-sided tape. I would expect the problems you describe with the thick stuff, but not with the thin stuff.

I'd love to see some ABS plastic and aluminum sheet metal cut up, I can mail some free samples.

I will  have a go at anything you send my way. Our address is: 

ADX/Maslow CNC
417 SE 11th Ave
Portland, Oregon
97214

I think sheet metal is probably pushing the limits of what you can do, but I really don't have enough experiance working with it to make that claim with any basis.

Let's find out! :-)
