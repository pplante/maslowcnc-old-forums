## spare pins
Posted on **2017-03-07 17:14:49** by **jbarchuk**:

How many of what kind (analog/digital in/out) of spare pins are on the control board?

Are there easy hooks or addresses in the software to access them?

There are six digital IO pins accessable in the beta version of the control board. Based on community feedback, I am making the next version of the control PCB have 4 digital IO pins and 2 analog/digital IO pins available. I have not written software hooks for them yet, but it would be relatively easy to do so.



As a beta tester you will get the beta control board now, and the updated version when we ship it to everyone so you will benefit from any more changes we make based on your input.
