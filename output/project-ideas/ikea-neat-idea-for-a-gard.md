@TheRiflesSpiral I only got a few minutes to look at the plans but I thought the structural portions of the greenhouse were made from just 8 3/4" pieces of plywood, the others are more decoration. No?
I'll admit, 17 sounds a bit nuts, 8 seems much better. :)

I'm confused now, because the article says 17 but the DXF has 12? I need to dig in a bit but I'm guessing maybe one or more of the 12 sheets in the DXF needs to be cut twice. (there are 13 listed at 3/4" and 4 at 1/4")

The 1/4" stuff is for "edging strips" that tie all the vertical supports together. I'm not sure those are optional though I suppose you could substitute with another method of keeping the vertical pieces upright.
