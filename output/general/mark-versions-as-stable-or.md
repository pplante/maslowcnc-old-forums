## Mark versions as stable or beta?

Perhaps we should create an area for users to download different versions of the software, stable or beta?  For example if a new user comes to the site and just wants a good stable working version the click button1 and if a user wants to help find bugs and play with the cutting edge stuff they stick button 2 on the website?

The tricky part is that I usually think every version we release is stable, but sometimes we find out otherwise once the release happens. This week was particularly bad

or another way to look at it is that we are in the beta-test stage, so every release is beta :-)



But seriously, if Bar knew the version wouldn't work, he wouldn't release it. Every version he releases passes his 'it works' tests. It's only when things hit the real world of lots of people doing different things with different releases that problems show up (or show up as being significant enough to be a problem)



If you don't want to be on the bleeding edge, never upgrade to a new version until you hear others are running it successfully. The problem is that if everyone does this, the new version never gets tested.

I think there is still a point. I needed a simple plywood carry device and since I have the Maslow, I don't bother with the jigsaw. Having a info about the latest know version combination that worked for more then...ehm... lets say 3?, would be of great help sometimes.

Not pretty, but damn useful to get the sheets from the garage to the workshop.  [IMAG0859](../../images/HI/bq/HIbq_imag0859.jpg.jpg)  Seen on a linked video here in the forum about some crazy genius inventor making a panel saw out of water pipes.
