The accuracy is stated as plus or minus 1/64". Is the stated accuracy for a single tool path or between two parallel tool paths?

That's the expected absolute accuracy (so either), currently we aren't getting quite that good, more like 1/16, but the issue is software, not hardware design, so it's currently being worked on.

1/16 is more than I can stomach. 1/64 would be terrific. I look forward to you guys getting that sorted out.
