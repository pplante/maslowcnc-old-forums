anyone know how I would be able to calculate downforce of the Maslow prior to receiving the kit?

what do you mean by the downforce?

I was wondering this, too. For me, it would be the weight of the gravitational force on the router and sled, minus the friction of this weight on the stock.

are you meaning downforce in term of pulling against the chains, or downforce as in keeping the bit in the workpiece (i.e. which direction are you referring to as "down", remember the workpiece sits at an angle)
