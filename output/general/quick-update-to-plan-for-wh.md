## Quick update to plan for when tier two sells out
Posted on *2016-11-12 13:49:31* by *Bar*

Hi everyone!

We've got a slight change of plans for what happens when batch two sells out. In our update we said that we'd open a new tier where you could put $10 down on a machine to hold your place in line, unfortunately Kickstarter let us know that we're not allowed to do a $10 pledge as a deposit on a machine. They were really nice about it, but it's against their terms of service to do a partial charge. They understood that we weren't trying to do anything sneaky, but rules are rules.

The new plan is that any pledge, even $1 saves your place in line. We appreciate you guys had our backs from the beginning, and we'll make sure you go first on the next batch if you'd like.

Our apologies for the change of plans.

Thanks!
