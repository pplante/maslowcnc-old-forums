## Maslow sled 1.2

Ok, my z axis is bigger than the standard sled. So I have been working on a newer design. I took the current sled and added on the design of the original sled and came up with this.

It increases the length another 7", but I think I can shrink that down to something more acceptable with later revisions.

What's the weight of that contraption? You may be able to forego the bricks altogether or add some weight in another way that doesn't extend past the bottom as far.

Don't have a final weight yet. I am thinking I can go down to 2 - 2lb weights though.

Ok, as the lift is now, I am just shy of 8 lbs. That is without the motor mount and the router. I am thinking I can get away with very little added weight. I can shift the assembly up and use the normal sled.. I will just have a new length of the chain mounts and cutting bit location.

That is heavy enough that I would try it without any added weight.

Ok, here is an assembled sled. Only missing the drive motor. Weight is at 12 lbs at this stage.

looks cool but a lot of work, just to use that dewalt router?

Try any router, dremel, scribe, pen tip, laser. This is a universal mount setup.

Great build! Gives you the option to use spindles as well. Any play on side force?

Won't know for sure until I get a completed setup.  At this point, it is a paper weight :) 

With next weekend being a holiday, I will have a few days to build the framework. I have some different design thoughts in my head for that.
