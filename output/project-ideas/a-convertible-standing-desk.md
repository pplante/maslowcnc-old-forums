## A convertible standing desk

some time back I bought a Veridesk and loved it! Except I'm 6' 8" tall and the system just wasn't tall enough. What would you guys think of building some sort of Maslow cut plywood-based desk like it, but designed to be cut to the size requirements of different people (that is, the "arms" which raise the table could be modified to fit different people). Aside from the tension springs, it's design is relatively straight forward and simple.  

Here's a link to Veridesk: http://www.varidesk.com/

I'm right at 6' and find the Varidesk to be a bit short for me as well... I can't imagine being 8" taller and trying to use one! On my project list for Maslow is a set of feet that raise my desk up enough to get my chair (and my knees) under it more easily.



The one nice thing about the Varidesk is its weight capacity which is afforded not only by the tension springs you mentioned but its all steel construction. It will be interesting to see what can be accomplished with less rigid and heavier materials!
