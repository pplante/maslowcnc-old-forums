## Drawing Program
Posted on *2016-11-16 08:16:48* by *brandonmc*

Ok I'm new to some of this so don't judge. Is there a simple program to draw with and what format should the drawings be saved. Should I just use a 3D modeling program or is there something simpler?

Sketchup seems to be popular. There's a web-based version of it that works in newer browsers. Also recommended by Bar are: www.makercam.com for simple stuff and jscut.org which has some features makercam doesn't but is still simple to use.

Ground Control (the control software for Maslow) requires G-Code toolpaths, which can be created by either of those sites.

How long did it take to cut out your logo in the video?

Bar has stated elsewhere (can't find it now) that the Maslow logo took about 45 minutes to cut.

You can also look at Fusion 360.  It is free for hobbyist.  It may have a but more horsepower behind it than most users may need.  But the price is right.

I currently use emachineshop.com it is pretty easy to learn and can outbut DXF files and in bar's latest video he says you can convert from DXF to SVG easily I'm not sure how that is done though does anyone know what software Does the conversion?

I use this website https://convertio.co/dxf-svg/ to do conversions and it's worked well for me. You can also use a drawing program (getting back to the original question) like inkscape (free) or Adobe illustrator to open and save both file types. 

Occasionally I've had the web based converter choke on complicated files and then my default is QCAD (https://www.ribbonsoft.com/en/) which is a free windows/linux/mac CAD program.
