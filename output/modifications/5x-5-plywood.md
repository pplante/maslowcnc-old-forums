How hard would it be to change the size to cover 5'x5' plywood?

This was asked in the Kickstarter comment section by David Bernard:

@David Bernard Those are great questions.

1) Yes, 5'x5' sheets can be done. The size of the machine is a setting in the software so you can make it bigger or smaller easily. You may need to add a few links to the chains reach that extra foot. We're shipping with chains which are already a little longer than they need to be to allow people to play with the design but 5x5 might need a couple extra links.
