## Steel frame versus wood?
Posted on **2016-11-21 10:20:34** by **spyker**:

I'm likely to be in that group that will either order post-launch (since I missed the last openings in the Kickstarter) or will put together the parts open-source. I have also been looking into tiny home construction, and a big factor in the builds is weight. So, along those lines, whenever possible, although the cost is slightly higher (and I do mean slightly), there are a lot of advantages to steel frame architecture (1/3 less weight, better structural strength and integrity, fewer lifetime maintenance requirements).



I believe that, either wood or steel, could be slightly modified so that the frame would be able to quickly fold even more flat if necessary, and in my opinion steel would maintain it's integrity longer from wear due to assembly and disassembly.



Has anyone else thought about this yet and made plans to construct their framework out of steel instead of wood?

I was planning to make a dual collapsible frame from local hardware store parts of Uni-strut steel, hardware door hinges,  and Uni-strut brackets. One frame for the "media (plywood,plactic, etc..) to CNC" support and another frame for a moveable gantry to glide over the media so the media does not have to support the router. I have also looked at top fence railing and electrical conduit for a frame,  Uni-strut steel has all the hardware to do 90 degree corners and fasteners to attached items like corner motor mounts, hinges, etc.. The Uni-strut steel comes in 10 foot lengths so that works well when you are doing an 8 foot length of plywood as you will need your frame larger than your media. I figure 3 hinges for corners of the frame than one removable pin hinge for the fourth corner. (or a 90 degree bracket on the fourth corner) Pull the hinge pin and collapse the frame to a stacked 10 foot length that is 8 inches high. At least that is the plan.

I will mostly get to that around the December holidays.

I will be making my frame out of aluminum which is $2 a pound when bought from an aluminum supplier (local hardware stores have big markups).  but the gethub documentation is pretty vague on details, just a single sketch up drawing. I think I will wait till I get my kit to make the frame so I have a better understanding of how it all works.

The sketchup drawing is to scale. Using the dimension tools in Sketchup, you can measure the pieces and get the base ready any time.

My only concern with aluminum over steel would be the additional flexibility and, actually, lack of weight to keep the body solid. I'd be afraid of any sort of torque flexing the frame during use. I don't *think* it's a large possibility, but it's a possibility.

Just use thicker aluminum, thicker aluminum is stronger than thinner steel and thicker wood is stronger than both, it's all realtive
