## Chain slip on temporary frame
Posted on **2017-04-24 12:08:51** by **John**:

Hello.

I've got as far as building the temporary frame but I can't get any further. Just running the test shape script produces horrendous chain slip. I haven't even got as far as turning the router on and cutting any wood because I can't see it improving matters. Just moving the sled around in the initial test circle will slip multiple times on each chain. Each time it slips, the sled bounces and wobbles to a degree that means anything being cut would be mangled.

Is anyone else having this issue?

Also, how vertical or not should the temporary frame be? And which bracket hole should be used for attaching the chains to the sled? I can't see anything in the instructions that mentions either item. I'm wondering if the chain slip is because I am having to use an outer mounting hole in order to keep the sled flat to the board?

Thanks,
John.

Timely question! I'm working on cutting out my parts using the temporary frame also.

We should figure out a solution so that I can update the directions to be more clear.

Which hole are you using right now for the chain? (I would recommend using one of the middle two)

Are you using the temporary sled, or the full sled with the bricks?

I suspect the motor mounts are rotating, sliding the screw heads in the mounting slots.  Check your alignment John, make sure you have the cog parallel to the chain path to the sled.  Then, watch carefully, and see if the motor is shifting the plane of the cog with rotation on hard pull moves.  I put some stopper screws around the base of the mount to restrain it's motion.

I was dreaming of a plywood yoke motor mount we cut with Maslow, that puts the center of effort squarely on the chain path.  Then they could be fixed anywhere by hanging.  No frame needed.

That's a great idea. I also think I'll redesign the mount to have four holes for screws rather than the slots which they have now.

What you the yoke motor mount look like?

Like a sheave yoke with a flat base where the motor rides, and a hole for the chain to pass through.  Or maybe like a tiny motor gondola.  Hold on, check out this video from my front yard.....

Like that!  That one's got a Cummins in it, but....you get the idea.

That's a REALLY cool idea. It seems like it would solve several problems at once. Let me know how I can help.

Also, from the bits and pieces of your world that slip into the background of your posts, it seems like you are living a pretty fantastic life. That's an amazing tree moving sling.

They were logging the DNR right behind my house.  I was just spectating, and listening to the Talkie Tooter.  I don't have one of those!  But thank you!

I'm at work at the moment so can't check on current hole selection. I did try a few different options though. I'm pretty sure the motor mount is not rotating. It is certainly not loose on the frame. I can't image it twisting within the bracket or bending the shaft either. As per the instructions, it is mounted parallel. I will try angling it to better match the chain line.

If the chain is slipping, there are only a few possible causes

1. the slack of the chain is hanging at an angle that doesn't feed the sprocket, so it slips as it lets chain out

  tilt things closer to vertical and see if it solves the problem.

  try adding a chain guide to wrap more chain around the sprocket

  add some support mechanism for the chain to move it closer to parallel to the bed

2. the chain mounts to the router are at a height that causes the chain to be at an angle to the sprocket (worse the closer the sled is to the motors)

  adjust the mounting to the sled

3. the sprockets are not flat compared to the workpiece (motors twisted)

  align the motors to be more parallel

4. not enough teeth in the sprocket engaging the chain for the weight you have (very unlikely)
 
  add a chain guide to cause more of the chain to be wrapped around the sprocket.

I seem to have fixed the chain slip problem by angling the motors out away from parallel. In order for the sled to hang flat to the work piece, I am having to use the second most outer hole for the chain mount. Anything less and the sled tips up when traveling downwards (if not  when just sat idle if I move use a hole too close to parallel).  

So I can now get the sled to move around smoothly and have tried cutting the square/circle test pattern. It sort of worked but it I get a square that is 150mm across and 160mm vertical. Definitely visible distorted on the circle too. However, we are no longer allowed to change the dimensions in the settings page so can't adjust for non circular circles?

Great and very timely question! I'm working on getting this week's software release out right now. Give me maybe 15 minutes to get things posted and the new version which fixes the settings problem will be up.

Great work figuring out what was going on and fixing it!

Would you be willing to tell me more about how you fixed the chain slip, or maybe share a photo? It sounds like something that we could share with more people to solve the problem for everyone.

As I say, I just angled the motors out. The mounting bracket is held on with two screws in slots. So you have quite a bit of adjustment to play with by just loosening those screws a little. No need to completely remove them and start over. The only problem is that you need to remove the motor entirely to get access to the mounting screws! So you have to make your adjustments blind, put it all back together and see what kind of angle you now have. Note also that the more angle you put on the motor, the worse the connection to the down chain. However, slippage due to misalignment on that side isn't as critical an issue as slippage on the live side.
A better option would be to move the entire motor and chain tension setup further out from the frame so it is all in line with the sled mount but still parallel to the work piece. E.g. attache an extra piece of wood to the frame arm to mount the motor further forward.

Got it. I think that same problem is addressed on the final frame by the motor mounting plates which move the motors out more.

The newest software should be up, and ready to download :-)

Yeah, I figured it wasn't worth trying to over engineer a solution for the temporary frame. All you need is something that is 'good enough'.  I probably won't get chance to play more for a while though - busy weekend approaching!

Well have a good weekend and let me know how everything goes when you get back!
