## On my Mac Laptop

So when I run Ground Control with the Sled G-Code it crashes.

I do the same thing on my Mac Desktop and it loads it perfectly. I see the colors and the pathway.

What could it be?

Do you see any sort of error message?

There is no error message just a crash...Im going to delete GC and download the latest version from scratch to try again.

@Bar, so a simple reinstall did the trick, the sled G-Code loads up on the macbook. Im really starting to get the hang of this stuff lol.
