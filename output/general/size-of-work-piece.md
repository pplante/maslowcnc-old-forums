what is the smallest sized work piece the Maslow is capable of creating reliably?

That's a good question. I've mostly been asked what the biggest thing Maslow can make is. [This post](http://www.maslowcnc.com/forums/#!/project-ideas:a-curiosity) from yesterday shows off one of the smallest things I've ever made (albeit accidentally).

Maslow is designed to build human scale objects out of full sheets of plywood. If you are looking for a machine to do very small ultra intricate work you might want to check out a machine more like the [Carvey](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/carvey)

it can work on very small items, as long as they are surrounded by support material. With the maslow design, the router is not supported by the frame in the Z direction, which means that there needs to be enough material for the sled to be supported all the time. This means that the surface it's riding on must not be small enough that it falls into the hole in the sled, and if you don't support the sled down to the center of gravity of the sled, bad things will happen  (in the reference design, this is abut 3" below the bit on the sled)

In theory, this would let you cut on something as small as 4" or so, but really, you would want a lot more support than that all around.

Near the center of the sheet, according to a over 2 weeks old test i tried (and allot has been done since then), the Maslow can cut within a 10th of a millimeter. Giggle says that it is within a 0.00393701 of a Inch.
