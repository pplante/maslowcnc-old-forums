## Instructables CNC class...

First off, if you're not a frequenter of the Instructables website, you should visit and sign up for their emails. It's where I got my Bluetooth speaker bug and there are always interesting CNC/3D printer projects there.

I got an email today advertising a CNC class and one of the topics covered will be flat-pack furniture; something that's (admittedly not sexy) but is right up Maslow's alley, particularly as we're just getting started!

If you're on their email list, you can sign up for free. Premium members also get the classes free and honestly, $30 is a steal if you have to pay for it... especially for a beginner like me!

I got that too today, signed up as well.  The classes are good that I have gone through so far.
