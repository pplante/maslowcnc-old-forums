This appeals to practically ALL my interests... it's likely to be first or close to it!

That is bad ass.  I am picturing one cut from solid stock rather than ply.  Geez, the possibilities!

That one is really well executed from a design standpoint but I doubt it sounds very good... the author admits (on reddit) that he didn't put any thought into that aspect and just glued a bunch of parts in the cabinet. I'm thinking of integrating a second D-class amplifier and a 5" bass driver and passive radiator to boost the lows. And use a LiPo battery for better life.

Put more thought into the shape and volume of the box rather than the components.  You will realize way bigger sonic returns with proper acoustic calculations and design, in my opinion.  Of course, better components are rad too.

So somebody who knows about sound should come up with a design and share it. Because it's pretty and I like it. But not enough to worry about proper acoustic calculations...

I'm happy to do so. I've built a dozen or so sets of speakers for my own use and already have the resources/software for cabinet design, etc... Just need a machine so I can prototype it!

Hey RS, I've got a few pair of old KLH, Altec, JBL, and SpeakerLab speaks rotting away around the place.  Most of them are too big to ship and the cabs are shot from moisture.  Let me know if you go looking for drivers, I may have some for you and I would love to get 'em gone.
