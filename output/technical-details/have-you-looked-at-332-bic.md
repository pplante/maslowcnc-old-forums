## Have you looked at 3/32 Bicycle Chain?

I was thinking about how you are a roller chain, I can't remember the size what you mentioned in the video. 

But, in my mind doing a 3/32 Bicycle chain(used on Track, and BMX, Wider then 1/8 single speed bike chain) would be really cool idea. It would also be easy to modify withe longer or shorter sections if someone wishes to do so.



Just something I was thinking about. 

PS, im a bike mechanic, so that is why I might see a benefit to this.

Yes! That is where I started. I wanted to use bike chain because it's so easy to get anywhere in the world. It ended up turning out to be cheaper to buy standard #25 roller chain in bulk which is why I switched. 



Thanks for bringing that up again. I still love the idea, and I'm keeping it in mind.
