## horizontal 2x4

Is there a reason this needs to stick out past the width of the pywood sheet?  Sweems like a tripping hazard.  Also, is it possible to lower the entire machine on the frame, possibly having that horizontal 2x4 just a couple inches off the floor?

@mattnelson the 2x4 extends to a point directly under the motors to accommodate the tensioning system. It's not a tripping hazard because the motor mounts are at eye-level and extend that far as well.
