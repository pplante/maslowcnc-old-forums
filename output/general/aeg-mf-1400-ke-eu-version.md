## AEG MF 1400 KE - EU version of R2200
Posted on *2017-02-27 23:39:11* by *mazeltov*

So i received the AEG MF 1400 KE router and it is definately the exact same as the Ridgid one except different branding and a bigger pricetag. It comes with a few more accessories and a second base (plunge).
Ordered at http://www.rotopino.de/ as they were the cheapest option i found (290 /wo VAT, shipping included) they shipped fast and the contact was friendly and competent.

that looks like it all right.

do you have the ability to measure the runout of the shaft? I just broke the router on my current CNC gantry machine (too much vibration and a weak mount, the router went flying) and am debating getting one of these for that purpose or going with a purpose built spindle

Well i been lazy and just ordered the 0.375 Ridgid coupler since the router seems 100% identical besides the branding & the handles ;]

Good work finding that! It's pretty convenient that there is a EU version :-).

Would you be willing to throw it up in the routers page on the wiki? I think its a good resource for people to know about

Sorry for the spam, missing an edit button. We desperately need a professional forum with organized categories and subforums. The faster the better :3

You can edit only within 2:40 minutes of hitting the Reply button. M00t policy. They don't want anyone 'changing/modifying/adjusting history.' Granted that other forum software has a field where you can describe -why- you edited a post, but that probably makes too much sense to be reasonable. ;)
Oh, the edit button is invisible till you hover around the top of the post, to the right of the user icon, name, and time posted. There's a countdown timer that says how long you have till it's cast in stone. The hover says Delete, but what it does is send you back to edit mode with all the text you were writing. M00t likes lots of invisible icons that you have to know where they are to find them.
