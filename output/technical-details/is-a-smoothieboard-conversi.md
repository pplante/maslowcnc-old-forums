... or even advisable?  Other than the network capability, would there be any advantage?

The smoothieboard is awesome. I guess the question would be what would we be trying to achieve, and is it worth the extra cost. I personally like the arduino because it's cheap and very standardized. 

I guess it's also not entirely up to me :-)! As an open source project if it seems like the community really wants to add support for the smoothieboard, it's going to happen. At $100 it adds quite a bit to the price so It's probably not going to by my number one priority, but once I get all the bugs worked out and features added that I'd like to see, it's something I'd be open to exploring
