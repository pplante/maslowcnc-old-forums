Great video.  The .5" Z movement for each pass should be the "Safety Height" setting in Makercam. When using tabs in Makercam, I had the same experience as you.  Problem went away when I switched to Easel.  I'd be curious of the results if you tried the same file and setting in Easel. The objects you are working on have more detail than what I've tried thus far.

Looks totally awesome!

@makermark is spot on about the z-axis movement. You want to take the "safety height" down, I usually do .15". 

Loving the videos!

Those rounded corners on the stencils should be no problem. Maybe give a slower federate (20 ipm) a go and see if they come out more square. I need to rewrite a big chunk of the feedback control system before we can run at the full speed of the machine accurately.

Beautiful! I can't tell you how cool it is to see the machine in someone else's shop
