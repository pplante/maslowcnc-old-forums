# Maslow CNC Old Forums

This repository is a browsable backup of the old forums for Maslow CNC.  Previously the forums were hosted using Muut, and the content was thought to be lost, until now.  This repository contains the Python 3.6 script and JSON backup from Muut which was used to generate Markdown files of each thread.

GitHub allows you to browse old threads, and even allows you to search the content!
