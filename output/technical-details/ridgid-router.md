will the RZZ200 work? as I see them available refurbished for 1/2 the cost.

I searched for it, but I couldn't find exactly what that is. Does it look pretty much the same?

I see a ZRR2200 which is a reconditioned R2200 with the fixed base. If the plunge base isn't needed for the z-axis, this looks good to me.

The z-axis arrangement Bar shows looks like it uses the depth adjustment mechanism on the fixed base R2200. That makes that reconditioned one very tempting.

I actually bought mine reconditioned and I'm very happy with it. I couldn't tell that it had ever been used before, but I may have gotten lucky. 



The depth adjustment mechanism is one of the reasons I chose this router, but there are a number of other similar routers which use more or less the same mechanism which should work just as well. 



I'm planning to make a video about what features I like about this router and talk about some other ones I like too in the next week or so.
