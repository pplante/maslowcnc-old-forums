With each pass you can cut about 1/8th inch, by using multiple passes you can cut up to about 1.5 inches think.

would you be able to turn your work piece around, and mirror cut the other side?

Yes, as long as you align the part precisely that will work.

That's a good place for locating pins.  Put a hole or two in both the workpiece and a couple in the the table and drop in the pin.  When you flip the workpiece and re-pin it.  As long as the locating pins are in accurately known spots (like you did them with the Maslow) you'll be in the right place.
