## Reference NC file for set up/troubleshooting
Posted on **2017-03-24 16:32:05** by **rancher**:

Do you all see any value in sharing a g-code .nc file that is known to work in Ground Control, and has whatever elements we all deem useful as we go through this set-up and debugging stage?  Something not too big, that we could all take to our machines to eliminate conversion to g-code variables, and that would allow us to provide feedback that we could all relate to and replicate.   Something like the sled, but with no z-axis confusion and maybe a few more corners and straight lines.  I would feel a lot more confident troubleshooting with a known-good .nc file to test with as I don't trust any of mine.

I think that's a great idea. There are a couple available in the "gcodeForTesting" folder that comes with Ground Control (or [here](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/tree/master/gcodeForTesting). 



I chose those because they are simple but each have some combination of curves and straight lines.

They really don't make it easy to download files. If you are looking for how to actually download these it's like this:  [How to download](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:8e0c:how.jpg.jpg)

I just grabbed the whole zip, sorry for the bother.

That works too! I just wanted to post the "right click on raw" trick because someone showed me that the other day and I thought it was cool :-)
