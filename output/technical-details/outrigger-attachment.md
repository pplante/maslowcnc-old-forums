## Outrigger attachment

OK, next weird question. Looking at the sketchup drawing of the machine let to the question of how the outriggers for the motors attach to the backer board. 

I assume the 4x8 sheet then has a sacrificial sheet over it, or is it the artificial sheet?

Either way, I'm curious on the motor mounts :-)

Not a weird question at all!

The arms for the motors are screwed to the 4x8 sheet. The arms are two sheets of 3/4 plywood so the top layer is in plane with the back of the machine and everything is wood screwed together. You could glue or epoxy them in place if you wanted to, but I like that screws give me the option to make new arms if I wanted to.

The motor mounts which attach to the top of the arms press fit into place and are then held with a U bolt.

You don't have to use a sacrificial sheet, but you probably should. I leave a sheet of 1/4inch MDF that I already cut a lot of things out of back there.

Thanks... given use of a sacrificial sheet (or even just a thick main sheet), have you seen issues with the thickness throwing things off? I assume there is enough flex in the chains to deal with several inches, but wondered... 

Could I put a several inch thick slab of wood (or something) up there and engrave on it reasonably?

You should be fine even up to a couple inches. 

Toward the bottom of the work area it's not an issue at all, up toward the top the alignment of the chains is more critical so anything more than a couple inches might require moving the motors forward a little to keep the chains aligned properly. 

Basically, yes you can do that. If you somehow have a full 4'x8' slab, you'd probably want to do a test run with the router off before you start cutting :-)
