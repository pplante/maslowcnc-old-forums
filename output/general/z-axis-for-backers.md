## Z-Axis for backers

@Bar this is just a suggestion but I would layout the ground work for backers that a Z-axis is highly highly recommended. I can not imagine life with out it, I know it could look like an up sell so be careful  but that thing is pricless

I didn't have my z from day one.  I really miss hand turning that knob eight hundred thousand times per cut.  Not!
