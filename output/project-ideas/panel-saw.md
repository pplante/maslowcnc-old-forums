## Panel saw

Maybe this is already there, but just a thought... how about some "predefined cuts" in the software to handle "panel saw" type actions. Straight line cuts, or even predefined circles, etc. (stretch goal :-)).



If you looked at the Shaper Origin (https://www.shapertools.com) then one of the things that looked handy was a way of making some quick cuts/shapes without the entire "design it, convert to gcode, upload it" cycle.

That is a really cool idea. Really the reason I wanted to build this thing was to get more people involved with making things with CNC and I think that idea could be huge for making the process of getting started less intimidating.



I'm not sure I want to make it a stretch goal because I really want to focus on delivering exactly what we promised, on time. 



I guess that just makes it a regular goal :-)



If we just wanted to make a "cut line" or "cut circle" button, that would be really easy, but to do it right, we need to take into account the width of the bit you want to use to make the cut. What we really need to do is integrate the features of www.makercam.com like cut a circle, into the maslow software. 



I think after all the bugs are tracked down, this is my first goal as far as adding features.

I was teasing (kind of) about the stretch goal, at least as far as Kickstarter... we use the term in my office to mean anything "extra" that you aren't required to do... except that by the end, you'll have to do anyhow :-)



Anyway... glad you liked the idea. Happy to try to help as I can to figure out how to do it.
