There's nothing earth-shattering CNC-wise, but I find it fascinating that the go-to tool for this kind of simple joinery is now CNC where 30 minutes with a table saw and a mortiser would do it too. As a traditional and mechanized woodworker, I feel like I did when I had to migrate from the drafting table to a computer screen... It's De ja vu all over again!
