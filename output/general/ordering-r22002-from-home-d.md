## Ordering R22002 from Home Depot Fails
Posted on *2017-06-13 16:12:36* by *mooselake*

I'm over 100 miles from the nearest Home Depot (yes, I know most of you here in the states don't think that's remotely possible) and as ship day is approaching figured it was about time to order the router online.  Ordered lots of stuff from HD that way,  Today, not so much.   Big fail.

HD claims free shipping on most orders, but not for one of these.  The only options it would give me were store pickup (pretty much kills a whole day) or "Express Delivery".  Express Delivery was $79 (so much for "free") and "not available for your zip code".  No option for UPS/etc. ship to home.   Huh?  They'll ship the upcut carbide bit, no problem, but not the router. 

The big A Prime Marketplace has the R22002, but it's over a hundred bucks more.  Same for any other source I can find.

Fortunately I had a family member who was coming back from a trip to troll land (below the Mackinaw bridge...) that could stop and pick one up.  Just be aware that you might have trouble ordering one online if you're one of the two other backers without a local HD.

Glad you found a solution.  What part of the U.P. are you in?

Keweenaw Peninsula, where there really are moose :)  Are you anywhere close?

From reading reviews it might be a good idea to pay some attention to how the aluminum router fits in the magnesium base.  There have been some reports of corrosion between the two, and my new router is a bit blotchy like it's thinking about it.  A trip to the buffer and some waxing (like SlipIt) might be in it's near future.

I've noticed the same sort of corrosion on my Mg-bodied Ridgid routers. Slip-it doesn't seem to last as long as BoeShield or just some paraffin wax.

Contacted HD customer service, and got this reply:

Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback Kirk. I am sorry for any frustration that this has caused you. I have reviewed the RIDGID 2 HP 1/2 in. Corded Fixed Base Router and I see that this is an in store only product. Express delivery is when the product is being delivered from the local store. The product would not be shipping from a warehouse and this is why there is a $79 fee. Usually when express delivery is chosen, it is for larger orders and can only be delivered in the local area.
While we do offer free shipping for orders over $45, not all products qualify for this promotion. To verify that a product qualifies, check the product information page. It will say ‘Free Shipping on $45 order’ under the add to cart button. If it does not have this, the product does not qualify for this shipping promotion.

@mooselake, not too close (Northeast Ohio) but my family has been vacationing near AuTrain since 1923. I'll be up there in August.

That's a two and a half hour drive,  a bit far for a casual visit.  However it isn't too far from the closest sources of cabinet plywood (Lowes and Menards) in Marquette.  With luck my Maslow will be making cabinets to finish out the barn woodworking shop by then. 

94 years worth of vacationing in AuTrain!  Does your family have a camp/vacation house there or do you just like the area?

We don't have a place of our own, but we have rented from the same family all that time. I doubt we'll make it to any where close this year, since last time we went up to Copper Harbor. Gotta mix it up!  We always go into Marquette at least once during our week, tho.

You were less than 10 miles away from the Mooselake Manor if you went up US-41.  Enjoy your trip!

I don't know what shipping is like but if you're okay with having a refurbished tool, you could always get it from [Direct Tools](https://www.directtoolsoutlet.com/catalog/product/view/id/1125/s/rgd-fixed-base-router-rcn-zrr2200/category/117/)

How much was shipping? I have two stores within driving distance so I've never ordered from them.

FedEx ground was free. I had been watching refurbs on Amazon for months at $120+, figured it was not going to get better than $90. I use Dewalt routers around the house and in my table and I love them but the depth system is not at all Maslow friendly so I am happy to get a cheap single-purpose router that works well with the Maslow.

The refurbished router arrived today. Other than the "REFERB" stamp on it everything looks and runs perfectly. Everything is built and ready and waiting for the Maslow parts here!
