## Questions About Ground Control
Posted on **2017-02-01 12:06:48** by **chauhuh**:

How does Ground Control physically interface with the maslowcnc? USB?



I was thinking of picking up this cheap windows 10 tablet in order to run my machine. Will it work?

The connection is USB. Bar uses a similar tablet, I think. (You can see it in a few of his videos) He mentioned that it's inconvenient that there's only one USB port and it's also the charging port.

+1 for everything above. The connection is USB, that tablet will work (I use the exact same one), but the fact you can't charge it and use it at the same time is a pretty big hassle. I would recommend one which has a separate charging and USB port.

The Maslow board can put 5V on the USB power pins. ;)



I don't know what kind of power interface protocol is best. A current limiter and back EMF protection might be good ideas.

Does anyone have a suggestions on a tablet that has a charging port, and a separate USB port that doesn't break the bank?

I have a WinBook TW801 that's basically the same but has one full USB and microUSB charging. For some reason though, it seems to have gotten incredibly hard to find anymore.

Apples new camera kit includes a port for charging and USB

Unfortunately, GroundControl doesn't currently run on the iPhone or iPad.

search the iphone store for grbl and the controllers that finds should work with the maslow (once it's setup anyway)
