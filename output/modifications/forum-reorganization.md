## Forum Reorganization
Posted on **2016-11-15 14:04:07** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

Hi, All!



It's a new channel! The "Modifications" channel is for all the really creative things that backers are planning to do with Maslow when they get their hands on it. The gantry, Ãœber sled, speed control, etc will all be discussed here as well as all the other interesting things you'll come up with.



Bar is really excited about the conversations this project has started and wants to see that attention focused to one area of the forum to keep tabs on it, so here it is!



This channel is about open source at its finest and you may find a post moved to or away from this forum... if that's the case and you think I've moved it erroneously, just drop me a private message and we'll talk it through!
