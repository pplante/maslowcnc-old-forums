## Modular Cabinets

I'm surprised I cannot finding pre-designed cabinet plans for CNC. Any big box store will have a catalogue of available shapes and sizes to order. For example, Ikea (skip to page 34): http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/pdf/buying_guides_fy15/sektion/System-bg-SEKTION.pdf

I'm surprised there isn't an open source project where a similar catalogue is available to download. Of course, joints are designed for the CNC creator, and all layouts can be downloaded pre-set to fit on standard materials (e.g. 4x8' plywood). Seems like it would be a really easy, helpful and interesting project.. but I haven't found anyone doing it. I have however found this for-pay software: http://cabinetpartspro.com/Features_ScreenShots.aspx

(note the software lays out the designs on a piece of plywood for you).

I've also found some neat Youtube videos, like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlnE7fgVx6k

But it seems like both of these are overkill and a recreation of the wheel. 

Have you found any open source cabinet plans?

I haven't seen anything similar to that, but I agree that it would fill a need. I know a lot of the local cabinet shops use 4x8 routers for most of their work, so I be there are some systems out there, but maybe not open source.

No need. There is software that can do it for you that is free or simple stuff.

@chauhuh I saw that software but figured the demo version was lousy and the full version (at $250) being too much.. but I'll check it out a little more closely. Thanks. :)

Also, Cabinet Parts Pro is for fully custom cabinets (which is really cool), however, many big box stores sell pre-sized cabinets. Because of that I imagine one could set up a series of cabinets that would fit almost any need. The advantage is the designs would be really fast to grab and print/cut. No need for exact measurements. 

Maybe I need to get CabinetParts Pro and create some standard sized pieces, then open source the designs (assuming that's ok with the software's TOS).
