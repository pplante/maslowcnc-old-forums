## Loading gcode
Posted on *2017-06-08 17:41:31* by *willishf*

Looking for an example gcode file to test something simple and something complex. Any example files specific for Maslow? What file name extension for loading into ground control?

Take a look in the ‘gcode-for-testing’ directory of GroundControl. One of the accepted extensions is .nc, though there are others; I think if you look toward the bottom of the Settings page in GC you can see them and change them (or is that the ‘Advanced’ page? Can’t remember, can’t check right now :) )

Ground Control is looking for a .nc or .ngc file. There's some test gcode files in the "G code for testing" folder in Ground Control, take a look and see if those files meet your criteria

Doesn't look like that directory is part of the zip file that was used to do the install. Found the directory on github.
