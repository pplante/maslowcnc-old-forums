## Whether to buy...
Posted on **2017-05-15 19:27:40** by **noreaster**:

Trying to figure out whether to buy the Maslow, or wait. I don't _really_ have a place for it -- I could try to clear out some junk in the garage and make some space -- but what I'd like to figure out is whether there will be a second generation later on and I should just wait for that. Thoughts?

well, the nice thing is that everything is opensource, so you can build a maslow type machine without buying anything from them (and some people have).



the intent currently is to have more available later, but they said the same thing about the makesmith CNC and then decided later not to do so.



so if you don't buy the kit now, it may not be available later. But it may be, and there may be an improved version later, we don't know.

Our goal is to make CNC accessable to everyone. Like @davidlang said that means you can always build one with or without us (but it's probably easier with the kit).



I don't have plans for a version two, but I think we will continue to make improvements based on the community feedback. A lot of these changes will probably be to the parts of the machine which it can build for itself or the software. If we do make any changes to the nuts and bolts, we'll always make those parts available to everyone.



The real end goal of the project is to convince the big tool manufacturers that this idea is valuable so they start making machine's using our technology. From a business standpoint it's an aweful strategy, but with the goal of making CNC for everyone it's great. 



So to answer your original question I'd say buy one now if you want to be part of making something exciting and exploring the potential of this idea or if you want to be absolutely sure you get one, but we'r e doing everything we can to always ensure that as many people as possible have access to CNC in the future so hopefully you'll be able to buy one from us or someone simar then.

Thank you very much, @davidlang and @Bar!

You could make one hinged, like I did. It is flat on the wall when not in use. Someone else hinged it, so he can pull it up to the ceiling when the  car needs the space. Go for it ;-)

Sounds like a pretty good idea! Thank you!

it's the best deal out there. I say go for it!

Of course, asking a forum of folks who have already bought into (in most cases literally) the idea whether you should go for it, it's not surprising their answer is yes!
