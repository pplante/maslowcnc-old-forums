## Hello!
Posted on **2016-10-20 09:31:36** by **Bar**:

One of the things I'm looking forward too most is getting to know all of you, building a community, and seeing what amazing projects you build. I'll always answer your questions in the forums, but we wanted to create a space specifically to encourage getting to know us. 



So welcome! Introduce yourself! Where are you? Anything goes, so ask away!

Howdy! I'm Brian. I have an introduction post here but I'll add to it... I'm in Mid-Missouri in a town called Cole Camp. I've been involved in hobby and professional woodworking most of my life. I plan to use Maslow heavily in my shop making... well... any darn thing I want! I'm especially excited to extend its capabilities into joinery.

Great to meet you!

I guess I should introduce myself properly too! 



I'm in Port Townsend, Washington. It's a little town on the Olympic Peninsula with a pretty long history of wooden boat building.



This winter I'm looking forward to doing a kayak. http://cnckayaks.com/

Hey everyone! I'm Hannah, one of Bar's partners for Maslow. I'm also super excited to get to know many of you and see what awesome projects you come up with. I'm actually pretty new to the world of CNC, but Bar recruited me to get an outsider's perspective and to do all the stuff he isn't good at ;) I'm also in Port Townsend with Bar... Thanks for being here!

Great to meet you both. You both appear to be humble and intelligent people in the videos... plus exited and passionate about the project, which is what matters the most to me! (BTW I think the "printable" Makesmith is a great idea. I'm bummed I missed out on that.)

Hello, I'm Scott. I'm in Enumclaw, Washington,  a small town between Seattle and Mt. Rainier. I'm not sure what my first project will be, but your kayak idea sounds very interesting, Bar.

Hey, we're not so far away! Maybe a kayak meet up at some point in the PNW?

I'm Bruce - also potential use for boatbuilding (although a bit bigger than a kayak). I've done a little boatbuilding in the past, and having something that can cut a curve/odd shape reasonably (and repeatedly) would be really handy :-)

---

Posted on **2016-10-20 20:15:07** by **scottsm**:

A good idea. Port Townsend is a hub for boat and kayak building. Woodworking too, for that matter.

Hey folks! Atlanta here. Super noob to CNC but this looks like the perfect entry point.

Hey Gang!  I'm Matt, I'm out here on the OlyPen as well, West of PA.  I am super interested in this whole deal, but am a total CNC noob as well.  I see you guys are in PT!  Right on.  I have a million ideas for this unit, I won't bore you with the wild ideas, but....thank you for the possibilities this creates!  Looking forward to learning more.

Hi all, I'm John, and I'm an engineering mentor for a high school robotics team in Ohio.  We build all sorts of stuff, much of it robotics related.  We're hoping to get a Maslow CNC to build wooden prototypes for parts of our robots as well as building tools and fun projects.  



I've read about using CNC routers on aluminum, and we may experiment with that as well.  We build a lot of stuff out of aluminum.  



I am looking forward to seeing what the community is building.  Are there plans for a home for sharing designs?

Hey, I'm Bill, from up in New Hampshire. Our Makerspace often gets asked "Do you have a wood CNC" and the answer is no... we have lasers, printers, even a CNC Plasma and a CNC Mill, but no shiny wood machine. However this would actually A) Fit where we have space and B) Actually be affordable to us. So now we're getting excited. Add in Open Source, and we're even more excited. Eventual Z-axis would be awesome, but even without it I can see some serious use for this...

@jwolter and @bill_s welcome! Have you guys heard about our program to donate machines to community spaces? The short version is that for every 20 we sell, we're going to be donating one to a school or community space, you can learn more at http://www.maslowcnc.com/nominate .

---

Posted on **2016-10-24 10:36:50** by **Bar**:

@jwolter I've been playing around with the idea of a place to share designs. At the very least we're going to have a curated page with some of the best designs which have been tested, and which have clear instructions. 



I like the idea of doing a thingaverse style site too, but I'm a little hazy on what that would look like.



What are your thoughts?

---

Posted on **2016-10-24 13:21:35** by **alstaxi**:

Well since you are going to be so generous as to donate 1 for every 20 printers, I am almost obliged to pledge.

---

Ryan from Seattle here, pledged earlier this morning and looking forward to using the CNC for boatbuilding, furniture, and other various projects. Would love to attend a meetup in the area.

---

Posted on **2016-10-25 12:33:22** by **Bar**:

It sounds like we've got a really solid PNW community! Some sort of meetup is a must.

---

Posted on **2016-10-25 15:55:38** by **jwolter0**:

@td I can see a couple possible approaches to a design repository.  One would be a dedicated site, like the Sketchup 3D Warehouse or Thingverse or OnShape.  I've worked with the first and last and they seem to work pretty well.  Another approach would be to leverage an existing system.  For example, is there a way to tie repositories on GitHub together?  I haven't really used GitHub enough to know if/how this would work, but suppose I create a repository and somehow tag that repo as part of the Maslow community.  This would be a much more distributed approach, giving Maslow less control, but also less responsibility to maintain the platform.

Who knows what's going to happen to the my.Sketchup Beta, but 3D in a browser with a cloud repository is really fantastic... I hope they continue to offer it!

---

Posted on **2016-10-26 12:34:22** by **sparhawk2k**:

I'm in Seattle too so I vote for the PNW meetup!



I actually have very little experience in this but was looking mostly at furniture and maybe artsy things like fancy door numbers and signs. Though if I get very ambitious I'd love to do a greenhouse some day.

---

Posted on **2016-10-31 11:38:10** by **matthewrr**:

@sparhawk2k For the greenhouse, a combo of the wikihouse idea crossed with http://openbuildinginstitute.org/buildings/ is kind of my thought.

---

Posted on **2016-10-31 11:48:02** by **sparhawk2k**:

@matthewrr That would be amazing. I was looking at those too. I really hope the community here shares their projects like this, including the process from start to completion.

Posted on **2016-10-31 16:26:55** by **chadzimmerman**:

This is something that is almost exactly what I need for my projects.  I have been designing some "Flat pack" furniture and my one design is a rocking horse where it is just such a pain to router out with a template.  This would speed up a lot of things for me AND take up less space :)

Better late then never to say hello? Not sure, anyway: Gero is sitting on this side of the monitor. Passport says German, but my nationality is Earth. Stranded in the middle east. My luck is that I have never seen a university from the inside. That gave my the chance to think out of any box.

Posted on **2017-02-23 17:19:30** by **bdillahu**:

Hah! Sounds good, Gero :-)

Hi Gero! Welcome!

I've been a structural and architectural draftsman since I finished HS and I'm hoping this CNC machine will be my gateway drug to a new career possibly. I'll be slicing and dicing from Pacific Northwest.

Hi all!! I am a Maslow waitlister, but I thought I would go ahead and introduce myself. I am an artist who makes wooden wall sculptures, as well as wall sculptures made of other upcycled materials (work samples at link: https://www.instagram.com/p/BQJRtFjhMQI/?taken-by=theinspireddragonfly ). I am hoping to use Maslow to cut company logos to add to my work to make art signs, cut unusually shaped backer boards for my pieces, and who knows what else! I look forward to getting to know you all and to seeing what you create!
