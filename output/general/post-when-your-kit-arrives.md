How do I know which batch I am in? Does it just show up? I have not received an email or other tracking information.

milodar, If you look at your Kickstarter pledge you can get an overall idea of your backer number and your place in line. Not sure it matters. I was a batch 1 backer but I have noticed a couple of batch 2 backers already have received theirs. I did notice only yesterday did my tracking number that was created back in June 22 started to move. There was a picture in an update of the USPS truck full of packages. I am guessing that the USPS truck got loaded with batch 1 backers first then batch 2 was placed on top of that. The USPS people probably unloaded and logged the packages in that order so the top layer of batch 2 supporters got processed first until they got down to the bottom of the truck which was batch 1. Eventually we will get ours.

I'm not sure they differentiated between first round and second round for shipments; I was at the tail end of round 2 and was one of the first to get one.

Thanks, Tom. I'm backer 422. When did you get a tracking number? Was it emailed to you? I haven't received any communication regarding a tracking number.

I was backer # 519. There were 106 backers that were Beta and got their units first. There were 59 backers for support a school. There were 400 batch 1 backers. There were 250 batch 2 backers. Then there were 422 backers that were "pay what you want" or "buy us beer ;)".
If you are backer 422 and were not in the batch 2 and were not beta then you should be batch 1.
I got my tracking number on 7/10/2017 sent to my Kickstarter email account from info@maslowcnc.com.  All that email contained was my "after the kickstarter" Z-axis order along with the a USPS tracking number. When clicking on the USPS tracking on 7/10 all it showed was that the label was printed on June 22, 2017, 12:15 pm.
The next USPS tracking entry showed it was finally accepted July 12, 2017, 6:27 pm at PORTLAND, OR 97214.  
What finally arrived today (7/14) was my entire kit with the Z axis.
So it looks like Hannah and Bar got things packed up and shipping labels printed while they waited a month f or the final parts to arrive.
I am not sure if people that did not get the Z axis from their store actually got a tracking number. You can always email Hannah (hannah@maslowcnc.com)  and ask.

I looked at kickstarter again and it looks like I was batch 1. I can only say if I did receive an email then I must have deleted it by accident. I will email Hannah to see if she can shed any light on this. Thanks Tom, for taking the time to help me with this.

I believe from the post from maslow that they loaded the PO trucks twice to full and shipped. so most likely it's "in the mail" lol they are sent priority mail, so i don't think there is a tracking Number.

Priority Mail does create a tracking number if the labels were created online.

The tracking numbers are kinda confusing. What happening is that the Kickstarter mailing system made it really difficult for us to send out tracking numbers, while the system we use can do it automatically so tracking numbers went out for z-axies (bought through our website), but not for the rewards themselves (bought through Kickstarter). We do however have tracking numbers for every box so if anything fails to show up, we can track it down.

july 15, moose swamp, upper michigan.  also have a  cleaning project pending only it's turning part of a barn (with about a hundred years worth of stuff, 40 of them mine) into a shop.  Gosh, those motors and chain are awful tiny in person.

Dug further in the box; that was the Z axis motor, the chain motors are somewhat heftier.
