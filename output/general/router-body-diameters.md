## Router body diameters
Posted on **2017-02-03 18:20:50** by **jbarchuk**:

I need to make an adapter to mount a dremel rotary tool in more conventional router plunge base. I see bases available for the following routers. If someone has one could you please measure and let me know the diameter of the body?

Bosch MR23 series
Bosch 1617/18 series
Bosch Colt/Palm (Looking at reviews/demos, not sure this one has a suitable screw drive.)
Makita RP1101
Porter-Cable 690 series

This info would also be good to know for folks mounting other cutting/drawing/etc end effectors.

BTW if it's <60mm then you can reply with (model number) and a couple of :( :( because that takes it out of contention. Looking at vids I can tell I'm within the range of a few cm, but more accurate than that I can't tell.

BTW since I have a choice if anyone has general opinions about any of these plunge bases, very good or very bad, that'd be good to hear about too.

My two highest priorities are depth of travel and tool quality.
