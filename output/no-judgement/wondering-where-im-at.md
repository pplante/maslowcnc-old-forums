## wondering where I'm at
Posted on **2017-04-02 07:18:37** by **boandersen**:

I can only really dedicate time to this project on weekends, so I have not been following the last week or so. I have a temp frame, I have cut the circular sled out (YAY!). I've mounted the router on the new sled. I think I am ready to cut the other parts of the frame, and I've seen people post photos of those parts, but I have not found the gcode files for those parts. Have I missed the, or have I actually caught up with the rest of the class (for the first time in my life).

You are completely caught up!

I've got to spend most of today working on version two of motor controller PCB inorder to get them shipping on time. If you want to push on, .svg files are available for all the parts from [GitHub](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/blob/master/SVG%20Files/AllPartsSVG.zip) and you can generate your own Gcode from www.makercam.com . There are some videos on our YouTube channel which will walk you through the process. 

I will keep pushing the instructions forward as soon as I get these PCB designs sent to the factory, so if you want to wait, the instructions will be completed before next weekend.

Congratulations on being done, and my apologies for not having the next step written up!

@boandersen Just letting you know that you are not the last in the class. My kit is on the island somewhere, but in a country like this, I can't nail the local post or the customs down to tell me when or if I will receive it. I have a hinged frame, cut the sled with a jig and now all i can do is hang the router on the frame with ropes to at least get a feeling of what it is going to look like :-)  [MaslowBH](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:cqdf:maslowbh.jpg.jpg)
