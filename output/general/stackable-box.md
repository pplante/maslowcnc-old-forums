## Stackable Box

I just saw the update with blsteinhauer's nice rendition of the stackable box.  Dude!  How did you get it from the svg. to gcode?  I put that file in every program I could find and struggled with it for a full day before giving up.  What worked for you?

Oh, also, care to share the gcode?

Yea, I destroyed some wood trying that one....I ended up using Easel to get the Gcode, and I think that one the SVG from Illustrator or Inkscape.  And Try this:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/q7u2p3w74jg4vcf/Stacking%20Box%2016in.nc?dl=0

I used a 48x48 sheet of Iron Wood from Home Depot, 12 bucks for the full sheet  1/4 inch width.  Cut with the "super long reach 1/16 in upcut 1/8 inch shaft bit.

Still have to clean out the holes and a few were a little mis-shapped but it cut great.    Have fun my friend!

If you have trouble with the Gcode, I am on my way home and think I need to center the start point on the design.  I may have started that one from the lower left corner of the wood.

Here is the fixed Gcode for the Stacking box:

Thank you!!  I put it straight into Easel and it just would not process properly for me.  I sure appreciate the work you've done, thank you so much for sharing it.

Hey, so...how did it fit together?  How is your accuracy?

It is very tight, and a few of the holes are oblong, have to clean them up with a file, still doing that then will post the box put together.

Nice!  Thank you for sharing those.

is there a pointer to the initial .svg file? I'd like to attempt to dogbone the holes so that you don't have to clean them up after cutting them. I could work directly with the resulting gcode, but it's easier on the next guy to modify the svg instead :-)
