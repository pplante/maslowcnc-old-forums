## Router Brushes Maintenance

I don't seem to be able to link to a facebook 'closed' group so this text and image is stolen from user Alan Kreifelsâ€Ž in FB group Shoestring Router Builders.

quote... If you're running a router, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to pick up an extra set of brushes or two. The timing was perfect as I had just finished cutting some lettering and it was on its path back home when the router just died! The DW611 had over 150 hours on the factory set and from what I read that's about the norm. Got mine from Amazon. ...quote

I'd bet that bearings will eventually be an issue too. Those should be common parts not anything proprietary, so inexpensive and available.

Anyone using a 'dated' router might consider changing brushes and even bearings now before it might become an issue while using it with Maslow.
