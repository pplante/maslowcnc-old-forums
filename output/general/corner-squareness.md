## Corner squareness

How crisp of 90deg corners can Maslow make? In a few videos I see the sled kind of sticking and pivoting. I imagine it's critical to have the center of the bit where the chains would imaginary cross.

it can make very crisp corners, as you note, it requires that the sled not stick (and not swing like a pendulum past the point they are supposed to stop). It does NOT require that the bit be at the point the chains would meet (the math takes that into account)

people are experimenting with different angles of the machine, and different ways to make the sled not stick (polishing it, using a slippery plastic, waxing it among others)
