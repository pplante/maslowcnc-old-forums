## Test request #2
Posted on **2017-05-22 23:24:04** by **davidlang**:

I think we need to do a test and see if the chain brackets are flexing, I'd bet that they are.

could someone please put a square to the brackets while it is off the machine, make sure they are square, then hook the sled to the chains and check if they remain square, and give us an idea of how much they flex from location to location.

Please hook the chains to the uppermost holes to give us the worst-case situation.

The lowest tension is going to be when at the bottom corner opposite the motor, the highest tension is going to be the top center.

I've done this. I found no flexing at either location.

My sled is 3/4" marine ply, the brackets are 3/8" steel.

Seems rock solid here. They are not at a perfect 90 degree to start with, but that does not change. Measuring between them does not show a noticeable difference. 17mm sled.

Thanks, since the motors have enough power to completely rip the sled apart (~66 pounds of force on each chain) I was really expecting there to be some flex to them in the top center where the motors are both pulling almost as hard as they can.

I think that the sled material makes a difference. In my 'test-to-failure' adventure, the h-bridge chips gave out but the sled suffered no damage, the brackets no change.

hmm, the h-bridge chips should be easily able to handle 100% load on the motors, they are overspeced by 2x or more from what Bar said earlier, unless you send the wrong signals and turn on both sides at once, they shouldn't have a problem
