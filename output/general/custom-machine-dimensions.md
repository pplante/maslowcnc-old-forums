## Custom machine dimensions
Posted on **2017-06-01 19:39:13** by **umindedstrikesagain**:

I plan to use Maslow on Baltic Birch which is 5' x 5' sheets. I would like to mount two and have a 5' x 10' area. I can splice on extra chain so that's not an issue but how does the mechanics/firmware cope with dimensional changes?

you just need to define the machine dimensions (and workpiece dimensions) appropriately.



Then everything should just work
