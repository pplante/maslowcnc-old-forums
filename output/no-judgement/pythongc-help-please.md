## Python/GC help please
Posted on *2017-03-15 09:08:50* by *rancher*

Okay, I almost gave up, but after a couple days I finally got the python thingy done with the pyserial and kivy and stuff.  Holy crap, what did I get myself into?  I just want to run a router.  I had to learn how to find the cmd line, and then got stuck on the path business.  I know it's probably simple stuff to most of you, but......anyway.  The GC page says to do the little python cncgc thingy, but then it says, "run from folder." or something.  I don't know how to do that.  I think I'm almost there.  Any tips on what magic saying to type in the weird little black box would be super helpful here.

Hang tight! We're going to be posting a .exe installer for GC with the update this afternoon. We know software isn't everyone's thing so we want to make it as easy as possible.

Bar's tutorial was pretty dang spot on! That's -not- common because there are a hundred (a thousand) different ways for any install to fail. The pics helped a LOT because the UI on Github of this software is NOT intuitive for non-techies. Heck, entire shelves of books just about how to -operate- git have been written.
That tutorial page could include a disclaimer... 'If you've never seen a 'C:>' before, then fasten your seat belt because it's time for Mr. Toad's Wilde Rideeeee!!!! :) :)
But you're a kbd-newbie and you got through it? That says a LOT for the tutorial AND the stability and accuracy/compatibility of the software.

I've been doing this for 35 years and I assure you it is *NOT* easy. *EVER*!! *EVER*!!!! There are about a -dozen- different software 'technologies' I guess is the simplest word to use, that mix and boil and bump into each other in the stewpot and occasionally COLLIDE and crash. You saw some of the crashes  and hairpin turns but you -did- get through it. My install is currently hung on a point you hadn't even mentioned - there are a thousand ways to fail.
Now mix hardware into the pot and it gets worse-fast. That's what Bar spends most of his time dealing with, the pure software world vs the real life physical world.
As one of the great unwashed masses, -you'd- actually be the best person to start a -wiki- tutorial about installation. Copy Bar's info almost verbatim  While the oddities you experienced are still fresh in your head a few notes would fill in details that others will undoubtedly experience.

I figured it out.  Bar, your write up has the file as cncgc.py but that doesn't exist.  It's currently main.py.  

Thank you for getting the installer going, I almost thought I made a huge mistake with this.  I felt way in over my head!  All good though, and I'm learning stuff.  I know you guys are buried, thanks again for doing as much as you are.

I don't even know what that is.

Sorry for the wrong file name! We changed that last week and hadn't updated the instructions yet. I'll change that right now.

Kbd = keyboard. :) More accurately should have been CL-newbie, Command LIne. Similar to GUI, CLI is command line interface, meaning 'which button do I push to 'make it so?'' That plain text screen and aaaalll those buttons can be very scary for many people.
