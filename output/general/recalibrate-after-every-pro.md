## Recalibrate after every program version update?

Is it required to re do the chain lengths and calibration after every update?  Or does the machine retain these settings?

The machine retains the settings in a file in your home directory. Your calibration and other settings should persist through a version update :).

Should I then always unzip the download contents to the same folder?

depending on how recently you did the calibration, you may want to do it again, there have been significant improvements in the last week or two that could generate different results than previous versions.
