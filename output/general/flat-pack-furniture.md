Wow. $300.00 for a flat pack chair made out of laminate . I can pick up a non flat pack solid wood one at the thrift store for $ 10.00. I would hate to see what that "coming soon" desk 1 is going to cost. If a chair is $ 300.00 is a desk is going to be $800.00 ?

He posted on /r/woodworking about the cost of baltic birch plywood... he claims his local supplier is charging him $200CA for a 1" thick piece of 4x8? With material cost like that, this chair is a STEAL!

either that, or he's picking the wrong materials

It does look like 1" thick of 4x8 baltic birch plywood is hard to come by and expensive when you do find it. It seems like most people take two 1/2" thick pieces and glue them together which ends up being more reasonable in price.
