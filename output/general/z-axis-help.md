## Z-Axis Help
Posted on **2017-04-30 07:37:59** by **seventhram**:

Can someone please tell me which port to plug the Z-Axis cable too.
Can someone please post a picture of the mounting of their Z-Axis.
Suggestions on the best way to remove the knob and dial on a Ridgid R2200 router.

Great questions! I will make a complete set of instructions with photos by the end of the day, here's the short version:

You want to plug it into the middle port (between the left and right motors)

I don't have a photo with me, but this video shows how everything fits together: https://youtu.be/1phMS0_8zAA

The the knob is held on with a torx screw hidden down in that hole on the too of the knob.

I hope that helps while I write the instructions. Any advice about things you think I should emphasize in the instructions is much appreciated.

The Z-axis assembly guide is up [here](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/How-To-Assemble-The-Z-Axis) 

Let me know what I can do to make it better :-)
