## Two Questions - Tabs and cutting smooth cuts
Posted on *2016-10-26 09:48:39* by *tmkaiser*

I love the idea of this kickstarter and I'm planning on backing it.  Can you tell me, since there is no z axis at this moment, how to you handle the piece once it's fully cut through your material and loose.... wouldn't the work piece have the potential to drop into the router bit since you can't do tabs to hold the cut piece in place?  Also, the video shows on curves that it jumps a little.  Why is that?  It would also be nice to see the unit cut square cuts to show how true it can cut.  Awesome work by the way!

Thanks!

Those are all awesome questions, they are also our most commonly asked questions so clearly I've got to find a better way to answer them :-)

It's not really that there isnt' a z-axis it's really that the basic z-axis is manual so you can do tabs, but it's a more of a "hands on" cutting experience because you are going to be setting the depth every minute or so. I usually just have my cuts start at the top of the top of the thing I'm cutting out. When the cut finishes the part will sometimes slide down 1/8th inch away from the tool, which is kinda what you want. 

By "jumps" are you talking about how in the real time video you can see the bricks jump a little? That is caused by the torque on the router changing as it moves through the wood. The actual bit itself isn't moving very much when that happens because it is very near the center of rotation. If the brick way out at the edge of the rotation jumps say 1mm, the actual tool is jumping a tiny fraction of a mm. That is still probably one of our biggest sources of error in the final cut. 

Squares are a big thi ng that everyone keeps requesting so it's going to happen. I think I will get the parts to put together a z-axis today (fingers crossed) so it might be tomorrow before I cut a square, if you just want to see how straight a straight cut is, here's a picture of something I grabbed from the scrap pile  [Straight Cut](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s2/:maslowcnc:TfRs:straightcut.jpg.jpg). Because "straight" doesn't really mean anything to the machine, every line is handled the same, regardless of shape so you get the same accuracy cutting a square or a spline.

Thanks for the support and great questions!

"If the brick way out at the edge of the rotation jumps say 1mm, the actual tool is jumping a tiny fraction of a mm. That is still probably one of our biggest sources of error in the final cut."
I suggest facing the plate of the router that contacts the wood with nylon. A very thin sheet. It's very slippery, less sticky than metal.
Or is it a geometry thing and not a material thing that causes the jump?

I think you are correct that a smoother surface would help. Keep in mind too that the video was meant to show a worst case scenario where I was cutting on the D grade side of CDX plywood so the surface the router is moving across is awful. Simply flipping the plywood over to the C grade side would help a lot.

I was in my shop yesterday and there is a golf frisbee hanging on the wall.  What a perfect shoe for the router, was my first thought.

If that's the case I'm thinking the router position within the carriage should be adjustable so that it is possible to get the bit exactly at the center of rotation using some simple calibration procedure. This would only need to be done if the bricks move or the router is swapped out, etc.
