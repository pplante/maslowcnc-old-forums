## Is there an easy way to know when to update?

I don't have a great deal of experience with GitHub and I imagine that's where I'm tripping up. But what would be the easiest way to check and see if I need to update firmware or Ground Control?

I think I need to know both how to tell what version I have currently as well as what version is available. 

I'm fairly confident that by the time my schedule and the weather cooperate to allow me back in the shop to work on things that I'll have to update both, but I find myself struggling to understand the structure of GitHub. For instance, I only just realized that the Maslow Assembly guide links to wikis in the individual sections of Maslow's GitHub...before now I would go back to the assembly guide page them navigate back to GitHub from there.

right now, updates are happening extremely frequently and irregularly (sometimes several updates a day)

Until today's updates (which may not have been packaged into a release yet) there were no version numbers. I expect that @bar will post when this update hits (or at the very least, there will be more info in this weeks' update)

+1 for what davidlang said.

We're going to be posting official releases every Wendsday with the update and will increment the version numbers each week. Because things are changing so quickly right now, waiting a whole week for the latest software is a long time. 

Version numbers are a good example, we didn't have them until early this morning. Now when you connect to your machine it will tell you it's firmware version number and clicking the "About" button under "Actions" in Ground Control will tell you your Ground Control version number. 

I guess the best answer is to update every day if you are interested in having the very latest, or every Wendsday if you want to use an official "Release" with a version number which has been tested more carefully.

Hopefully in just a few weeks most of the big kinks will be worked out so updating mid-week will be less important.
