## Wheeled Maslow? And/or outdoor storage.
Posted on *2017-07-07 13:58:50* by *jimmyduong*

Has anyone added wheels to the frame to make the Maslow portable?  I'm short of garage space.  I'd take some section of the garage for storage only and move it during actual use. I haven't sourced any wheels yet so any suggestions?

Or potentially, I could leave it outside and remove the Arduino and router when not in use. But would the other parts be ok? Living in Southern CA.

PS.   Just received Maslow today and I was part of the Batch #2 KS group.

The arms and  legs could be removed to aid storing. If the arms were accurately dowelled or  keyed, re-calibration might not be necessary each time it was reassembled. I would worry about warping if it were stored outside. It doesnâ€™t need to be a full 4x8. It is designed to be adaptable :)

you better buy a big tarp and put on several layers of waterproofing as well. I like the idea, nothing worse than listening to a router for long time periods.!

adding wheels is trivial (bolt four castors to the bottom of the legs), as with any machine tools, I would recommend using locking castors. 

storing a wood 'thing' outside is a bad idea, and leaving chain out where weather can get at it is also a problem (think about leaving your bicycle out in the rain)

I would be looking at building a version that hinges against the wall or the ceiling rather than planning to store it outside.

I'm jealous. Being a Batch #1 backer you would think they would get theirs before Batch #2 backers. Hopefully mine is on the way,
