## "Calibrate Chain Length" - how to position chain?
Posted on **2017-06-17 05:52:07** by **thomasgkristensen**:

I've finally found the time to make a bit of progress on setting up my Maslow but I'm a bit confused about the calibrate chain length step. I understand that one end is attached at the 12 o'clock position on the sprocket, but what about the other end? Should that just be lose or does it remain attached to the frame? I fear it will just put a lot of tension on the elastic bands if I keep it hooked in?

I'm very happy there's a "No Judgment" channel for this type of questions!

the other end doesn't matter at this point (as long as it doesn't get tangled on anything), the elastic setup is just to keep the end that's not attached to the sled from getting tangled.

The end you are putting on the sprocket at the 12oclock position is the end that will be hooked up to the sled. You are just putting it there so that the machine can run out a known length from that point (watch that the chain doesn't try to wind around the sprocket, but keep your fingers clear, a piece of string through the chain will help)

Thanks! So the other end of the chain should remain attached onto the machine and the chain should still be wound around the bit held in place by the elastic band.

Thanks for the help once again!
