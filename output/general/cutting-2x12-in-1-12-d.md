cutter motor? More weight on the platter?

what do you mean by 2x12" 

by default, the maslow uses a 2.5 HP motor, going to 1.5" deep will require that you have a very long bit, probably something larger than 1/4" diameter :-) figure out how well a router will go through that material and then you can plan your feed rate (or just experiment and see how fast you can go)

Going to a water cooled spindle will mean that you have more 'stuff' hanging off the sled that you need to make sure doesn't generate too much tension on the sled or it can impact accuracy.

2x12 dimensional lumber (1.5"x11.5") would pose two challenges; first how to support the router sled at the edges of your piece? This could be accomplished with extra lengths of the same thickness material next to your workpiece. Second is the depth of cut. 1.5" is pretty deep for the types of bits you typically see used in a router but 1/2" cutters up to 3" long are available. I think it's doable but will need some experimentation with feed rates/number of passes, etc.

Now that I think about it, you may also need to consider the angle of the chains in relation to the workpiece (determined by the position of the motors) since it's about twice as thick as the target thickness. I'm not sure if the extra 3/4" would cause enough deflection to matter or not.
