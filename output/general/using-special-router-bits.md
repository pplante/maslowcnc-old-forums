## Using special router bits
Posted on *2017-06-09 12:01:31* by *beach4maslow*

Does anyone have experience using bits other than straight?  For example you are cutting a lid or tabletop and wanted an other than straight bit like a round over, chamfer, or Roman ogee.
Is this possible? Done using that bit only? Combination?  Or cut entire piece, remount then a pass around?.

Thanks
Bob

I have done engraving with a V-Bit and then cut out with a straight bit. For a round over I would try cutting the contour first, but not fully though, then the rounding and other stuff, before the final cutout. If your paths are aligned and offset by the different bits, I don't see why that should not work. All with one bit seems a little ambitious.

I've played around with a round over bit also and the results were good. The two things I found tricky were setting the depth just right so that the top of the round over was smooth and flush with the top of the part, and how to do tabs. I think @gero's idea of doing the cut first with a straight bit, then doing the round over on the part would make the tabs issue not a problem.
