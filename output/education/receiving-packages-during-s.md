## Receiving packages during summer break?

With the slightly pushed back shipping date I wanted everyone to think about if there was going to be someone at the school to receive the maslow package.  I know my last school day with the kids is June 9th, but the administrators have to work another two weeks.

Great point! We're more than happy to ship it to your house if that's an issue. We'll keep an eye on how the timing is going to play out and contact all the schools right before we ship just to make sure if it's close.

This is the first I have heard about a pushed back shipping!

I'll check my junk mail filters as the school is fairly aggressive but I know that the original messages came through. Is there an estimated time? We get out of school very early (May 27th).

they have been saying that they expect shipping to slip by about 2 weeks.

they were about two weeks late in shipping the beta kits, and don't want to cut the beta period short because it's finding and fixing so many things.
