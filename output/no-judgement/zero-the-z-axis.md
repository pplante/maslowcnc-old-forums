## Zero the z-axis
Posted on **2017-05-20 18:38:14** by **brianhurewitz**:

Has anyone (using the ridgid router) with z-axis attachment written up a step-by-step or even a simple explanation of the procedure for setting zero before running the cut? I've done it a couple of times and it's been hit or miss, so wondering if I'm missing something. I've basically been manually lowering the router to hit the material, then clicking z-axis > define zero. Any help appreciated! Thx!!!

I'm using the same approach you describe. I'm using a bungie cord to pull the router down, that takes some of the slop out. It's not a micrometer precision adjustment, though :).

for now, that's the way you will have to do it. Later on we can setup an automated zero (some mechanism to flip a switch when the bit hits a given depth), there will need to be software support for that, but it should be trivial when we get there.

hooking one wire to the bit (with a clip) and then putting a sheet of metal under the bit and lowering the bit until they make contact is a cheap way to do things, but you will ding the metal.
