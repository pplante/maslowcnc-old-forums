## End stops
Posted on **2016-11-12 15:41:34** by **karlthorp**:

Does Maslows controller have connections for end stops? Especially for a "Z" axis, however, "X" & "Y" could also be implemented by installing the switches on the router sled with "Bump Bars" that would make contact with a rail on the top and left hand side of the machines table
