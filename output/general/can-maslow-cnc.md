## Can Maslow CNC...

Since the Maslow can now be had with Z height control can it be used for "engraving". I make custom end-grain cutting boards. If I mounted a cutting board in the middle of the work surface and used a "V-Grove" bit if I could use the Maslow CNC to engrave names and such on a cutting board?

I do not own a Maslow CNC at this time but I am looking.

If you're using a V shaped bit, this would surely be possible.  

I don't have mine yet, but basically it would be just adding the text vectors and setting an overall depth.  I've done something similar with a ShapeOko.  You just need to ensure that the board is mounted correctly.

Yes, people have used the maslow to cut signs and similar things, you just can't cut away too much of the surface or the sled will fall into the cut area, and you need to have similar thickness wood around the piece that you are cutting for the sled to ride on.

Thanks for the replies! I figured it would be able to do that, but wanted to ask those in the know.
