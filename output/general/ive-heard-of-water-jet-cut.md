## I've heard of water jet cutting can anyone elaborate?

Water and abrasive are forced at high pressure through an orifice, creating a cutting medium suitable for displacing other materials at high speeds.

The water is merely a vehicle for carrying the abrasive material. Sand is common but there are others.

Typically the head traverses the material on an XY gantry. Usually no Z-axis is automated because it's strictly a cutting, not engraving or carving tool.

This machine would be a less than ideal platform for a water jet cutter.  This is in no way a critique of the design.  Using a nozzle and forcing a stream of water (high pressure) would force the head and platform away from the material that you would be cutting.  You would need to add a significant amount of weight to counteract the force of the water jet.

LOL David I just watched that last night. I almost convinced myself to build one until I looked into the price of the fittings and whatnot... yowza!

You can spend a lot of $$$ on the fittings.

Hackaday had a recent article on a low(er) budget waterjet cutter built with a pressure washer that linked to a youtube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg__B6Ca3jc

I'm in no way suggesting that it's an appropriate Maslow project.  Abrasive laden high pressure water whipping around the room like a rocket?  What could go wrong?

Although you could attach the chains to a large sled, attach the cutter on a fixed gantry, and move the work instead.  Again, seems like a way to be nicknamed "Stumpy" and finance a new yacht for your surgeon.

I had the good fortune of participating in some faux rock formation fabrication (like you see at zoos and whatnot) and that's the basic tool they used. It was essentially a power washer with a variable pressure trigger and an insanely small orifice.

They would glue a layer of structural foam to a concrete wall and cut a basic outline then glue another layer and cut to match, etc, etc. Watching a water stream slice through the foam with no effort was like watching a light saber IRL.

There was little hand carving after the fact and then shotcrete application. It's amazing how convincing the end result can be.

@mooselak_that hackaday article is referencing the video I posted a link to earlier.

The biggest risk with a waterjet isn't cutting off body parts, it's having the machine inject 'stuff' under your skin from the pressure. If you ever get hit directly by a high pressure jet (even the highest pressure nozzles from a pressure washers are enough to cause this), seek immediate medical help.

At TechShop, they require anyone working with the waterjet to wear a lanyard holding a "risk of pressure injection injuries" card on it, so that any first responders know that you may have been exposed to that sort of injury.

Even with this in mind, I've been considering building one.
