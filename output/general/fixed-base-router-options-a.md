## Fixed Base Router Options Australia
Posted on **2017-03-20 03:08:24** by **roberta_aus**:

Hi there! 



Apologies, if i have not searched all the threads properly, however has anyone in Australia had any luck of finding a Router which will work?  I can see a few people in NZ have resorted to ordering in from the UK & USA to make a complete fixed base router, hoping that is not the only option to get a compatible router in aus. 



Thanks in advance!
