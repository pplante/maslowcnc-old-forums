## Welcome to the land of no dumb questions!
Posted on **2017-02-22 10:10:13** by **hannahteagle**:

Hey everyone :)

As you may have read in the Kickstarter update, the creation of this channel is an attempt to draw in all those anonymous or "intimidated" users who might not feel comfortable asking their less-than-CNC-savvy questions in the rest of the forums.

I plan to share about "silly" mistakes I make as I'm the non CNC-savvy one between Bar and I. Please share about your mistakes as well! Or, if you have ANY QUESTION AT ALL, don't be afraid to ask. Even if we don't know the answer, we'll trouble-shoot it together in a judgement-free zone!

Happy mistake making!

That's a great great question. They are going to be used to attach the motor mounts to the arms in the final frame.

Did we discover the reason for the oval sled cut?  I plan on cutting the rest of the frame parts and don't want them all to look like it's owner, "little oval round the middle".  Ha Ha

haha, yeah nobody wants that. I haven't had a chance to dig into it, but it's the number one thing on my todo list so it should be pretty tackled pretty quick

The first place I would look would be to double check all the measures in the settings window and compare them to the real world. I know I last updated the instructions with the old temporary frame design so I'm a little worried that the software is ok, it's just a directions thing.

Meaning the distance measurements on the sled for
 the Maslow section of the groundcontrol?

For the sled and for the distance from the corners of the sheet to the motors

When you're back @Bar, could you provide more detailed instructions on exactly where measurements should be taken from?

So far I've assumed centers of motor shaft and center of router cutting tool but I'm not 100% certain that's correct.

Additionally, does the calibrate chain length take into account the tiny half link that extends into the sled mounting bracket due to how the cotter pin holds it?

Those sound like the right dimensions, but I think you are right that it could be more clear. I think a diagram in the instructions could help so I will make one. Thanks for the tip.

*Super-Emphasis: Anyone who has ANY potential confusion on ANY point, as Bar said in the instruction page, PLEASE write and say so. No one will judge you for your misunderstanding or confusion. This is a VERY complex machine, software, and process.
Your input is not only useful but REQUIRED.
I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE AND PROMISE that if YOU are confused on a point, then SOMEONE ELSE is also confused on that point.*

Yes-yes! Pics are best! (Much faster to make than drawings, and less visual 'interpretation' required.) As has been mentioned, some people are more visually oriented (me), some ppl are more list oriented (I'm OK with that), and some ppl more 'descriptive/paragraph' oriented (I hate that.)
Giving all -three- would be bestest, but it's time consuming, and prone to error when making changes. Pics are the most universally compatible because there's no language barrier for the no n-native-English-speaking folks. Pics are an exact representation of reality, rather than text which when -related- to reality are a kind of interpretation. Meaning getting across a point of -your- version of reality (which we're all trying to follow.)
The assembly instructions page is -excellent-! As I read it I actually looked for but couldn't find any points where -I- was confused or possibly misunderstanding. But that's me.
Example, it was a while back someone asked a Q about the motor mounts. I recalled a shot in a vid so I grabbed a frame and posted it and they said oh, OK, now I get it. Trying to 'descibe' how the motor, bracket, plate, u-bolt, sprocket and chain are assembled and oriented is essentially impossible. Well not impossible of course but verrry difficult given different ppls interpretations of the -exact- meanings of words.
