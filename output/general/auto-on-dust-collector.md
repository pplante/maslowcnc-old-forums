## Auto-on Dust Collector
Posted on *2017-06-07 06:39:06* by *nathanmiller*

Some years back I bought this wall plug unit for another project but I think it will be perfect for maslow: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005ELWUWG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T1_ZfaozbSPS49K3

Essentially, it'll figure out when the router is powered up and could fire up a shop vac automatically.

Those are super handy. I used one on my router table for years.

furthermore, I could see someone building from thin plywood (using Maslow to cut the parts, of course), something like this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002GZLCHM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T1_viaozb8XAYQ9A

Actually, this would be easy enough to make, and would collect most of the dust coming from Maslow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w8jXS8Fjh8

A Dust Deputy is very effective at preventing clogging of a filter when you're making very fine dust. (Sanding) The chips/"dust" from a router don't really need to be separated like that.

They also reduce the efficiency of your blower by a fair percentage that makes them less attractive. A ShopVac already has pretty low velocity and volume so you want to keep the efficiency as high as possible.

Excellent points. It'll be interesting to see what the standard set up will look like in the next year. I suspect we'll see a general "best practices" develop for Maslow over time.

Definitely. With enough of them in shops all over, patterns will emerge and it will be simpler to make recommendations to new users.

I used one of those one outlet tool running sense switch for my table saw to control my vacuum. Every other time I would run the table saw it would trip the house breaker as the table saw and the large vacuum ended up being drawing a bit over 20 amps.
You may want to invest in a dual corded current sense switch to run off two separate outlets like this one on Ebay. 
www.ebay.com/itm/iVac-Automated-Vacuum-Switch-/162108178998?

A Ridgid R2200 Router draws around 11 amps and a large 5 HP shop vacs draws around 12 amps. That pushes it over 20 amps.

another option is to get something like https://www.rockler.com/safety-power-tool-switch and power both the router and the shopvac from it.

The nice thing about those autoswitches is that there's a delay between the tool coming on and the DC coming on... that keeps your initial startup spikes from tripping breakers.

That Rockler safety switch is nice but still suffers from max power of 15 amps according to the specs.
According to the HomeDepot website the Ridgid R2200 is
" 11 Amp, 2-peak horsepower motor provides the power needed for dense material".
From the ShopVac website the 
"The Shop-VacÂ® 14 Gallon* 6.0 Peak HP** Wet Dry Vac"
draws 11.8 amps"
Combined you are looking at 22.8 amps. Is that constant running amps or peak power amps ? Usually it is running amps which would mean that peak start power would be even greater.
With both combined on one typical garage outlet of 15 amps it will trip the breaker even with a delay start. With a 20 amp line it may take it awhile to trip. Remember we are going to be running jobs that potentially take hours to complete.

I can tell you that my 12 gallon ShopVac rated at 11 amps only pulls about 6 when running. Likewise my 2HP Craftsman router rated at 12 amps only pulls about 9 when running. Peak numbers, at least with those two tools, don't represent steady-state running at all.

Now: 15 amps is common for household outlets but you won't find one in my shop. Most are 20.

a standard outlet in the US is limited to 15A, as is the standard plug that you are used to seeing (two parallel prongs).

a 20A outlet will have the two prongs at right angles to each other (like this http://internationalconfig.com/prod_shot/5366-ssan.jpg )

so it's very reasonable to have the switch only be rated at 15A

Mine breakers are 20 amps as well with 12 gauge wire through out my entire house. But then again I built our house and I did not cheapen out like most of the contractors around here that use 14 gauge and 15 amp breakers. In fact I lived in a contractor built house for awhile where they used a GFI in  the garage and daisy chained it to the inside bathrooms because they were too cheap to put separate GFI's in the bathrooms. Took me forever to figure out why one of the outlets was not working in a bathroom when the circuit breaker was not tripped.

Right... and [the outlets look like this](http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/1000/52/52a94315-a52e-430a-a8f7-8c4064e585d7_1000.jpg).
