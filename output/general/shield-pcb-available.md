I missed the kickstart and first wave of open purchases so I am building my own from source. 

I ordered a PCB and due to min quantity I have a few (four) boards that I am not needing. Let me know if you are interested I will let them go at cost ($6 each) + shipping.

This is just the blank pcb the parts have not been populated. I ordered all my components from digikey and soldered them on today. Everything seems like it is working properly.

you should sell the components too, would make it more appealing to diy crowd that can solder but aren't electronics nerds.

Well all the parts can be purchased though digikey with the part numbers on the bom. If someone has questions just ask. The board isnt hard to put together and is a great project if you are just starting with smd work.

^ Electronics BOM has been incorporated into the wiki (but could use polish) https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Electronics/wiki/DIY-PCB-Parts-List

I used that BOM to place an order from digikey recently. I reformatted it replacing the space runs with commas to satisfy their file import. All parts except the specific heat sink were available.
