## This week's update
Posted on **2017-05-18 07:47:01** by **Bar**:

This week's firmware and software versions included the much awaited change to how the PID controller works, better gcode buffering and a faster serial connection. 



I think it's a big step up, but I'd love to hear if others are seeing the improvements.



I'd also love to hear if the new features are not working for anyone.



I'd also love to hear if anyone plays around with the PID tuning talked about in yesterday's [update](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1830738289/maslow-cnc-a-500-open-source-4-by-8-foot-cnc-machi/posts/1888074)



Happy cutting everyone!
