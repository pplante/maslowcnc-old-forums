## Inkscape to GCode
Posted on *2017-04-10 11:12:15* by *TheRiflesSpiral*

I'm investigating a plugin for Inkscape that turns vector paths into GCode.

You can find the plugin here: http://www.cnc-club.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=35

Just wanted to get a post up here in case anyone is looking into this as well.

Here's a starting point that a former makerspace put together a few years ago (it's well battle-tested, but obviously only in our toolchain):

It makes a number of assumptions, but does neat things like pausing for tool changes based on layers (i.e. manual changes in laser power).

that's a well known tool for the job and has been around for a good while.
