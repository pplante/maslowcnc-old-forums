## 6 chairs per sheet of plywood?!

I ran across this design for a unique chair today and thought I'd share. Neat, simple concept and apparently the design creates 6 chairs from a single sheet of plywood. How cool is that?!

The DXF looks like 6.  The PDF it looks like 4 plus some extra parts plus some empty space (aka like it's not right)

Yeah I noticed that... it looks like the PDF was created hastily prior to posting to the website. The DXF makes much better use of the space.

FYI, I learned of the site while talking to someone doing some incredible community development with http://www.bridgeofgracecmc.org/ 

The organization is changing their low income community with some amazing results! For example, by mobilizing the city and resurrecting the homeowners association within their target area they reduced burglaries from 33/year to just 5 within 2 years. 

This year they're doing a program that teaches about various careers through hands on work. I got chills while they explained their dreams to me because I knew Maslow would be a perfect fit! This summer I'm taking mine into their community, the kids will learn about architectural design, and engineering, then help create pieces that'll be used in the community (in the parks they're building on empty lots, and maybe some park benches along sidewalks). It's an amazing organization with a cool vision. Can't wait to help them!!

I should also note, I was encouraged to submit their organization for the free Maslow for institutions - very cool that the Maslow team is giving some away!!

If there are other ways we can help or if you have feedback about how we can improve the design to work better in that community let us know! Great work!

Hi Nathan,



That link to betterblock was great! (As was the community development story). If you, or anyone for that matter, has any more links to sites like betterblock, please let me know or post them somewhere. 



Thanks, Michael Owen

hey all, they accepted my nomination for a "Maslow for Institutions" to go to Bridge of Grace Compassionate Ministries Center (that is the organization I linked to above). If it's ok with the moderators, could I beg and plead that you vote them up? Here's the link: http://www.maslowcnc.com/vote

Just pick Bridge of Grace Compassionate Ministries Center from the list. 

They're going to do amazing things with Maslow. I know it!!

You are more than welcome to solicit votes :-) Maybe I'll vote for you myself! 



You'll be first on the list once we start selling machines again.
