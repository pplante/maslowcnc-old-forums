## How many lines of gcode recommended?

How many lines of gcode do you feel is a safe number.  I attempted to load a file with over 60,000 lines and GroundControl recommends less.  Obviously I am going to break up the file so only a portion can be loaded at a time.

Great question!

I think the limit right now is 50,000 but we've been improving the speed of Ground Control a lot recently so we could probably go more. 

If you are comfortable with sharing the file I can run some tests on it and see if 60,000 gives us any trouble

note that after it's setup you can also use software designed for grbl to send the gcode instead of ground control. I would not expect there to be a limit there.

I think there was an error in my original gcode.  (Scaling issue) I updated it and now its below 50,000 lines.
