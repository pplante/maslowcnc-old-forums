Ground control errors out with [CRITICAL          ] GL: Minimum required OpenGL version (2.0) NOT found!
I saw a couple posts regarding opengl 2 and older hardware.   I don't think this pertains precisely to the previous thread, so I am starting a new one.  Windows 10 fresh install, i5-2430, intel 3000.  Installed drivers directly from MS.  Ran GLview, verified opengl 3.1 support is being provided by driver.  I also ran across this 
https://github.com/kivy/kivy/issues/3576
added Config.set('graphics', 'multisamples', '0') to main.py, didn't seem to make a difference, though I may not understand where that should be placed.

Any help would be appreciated.  Full log below

Try upgrading your graphics drivers and/or your graphics hardware in case of problems.

The application will leave now.

As an aside, I was able to run it successfully from the source code, just the prepackaged that didn't work.

Did you try installing the driver from the manufacturer and adding the lines in config.set https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34969990/kivy-does-not-detect-opengl-2-0

Could you possibly describe in more details how to insert these couple of lines of code? I have zero programming experience and have no idea of how to edit the code.

I read I many forum that windows updater update opengl driver but in my case it doesn't do anything to help open gl... Intel graphic acceleration is necessary to get 2.1 gl
