## Creating a .svg from SketchUp
Posted on **2017-04-15 08:20:47** by **nickandj**:

So I was following the video on youtube about converting a SketchUp file into an .svg and then into gcode using makercam (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0mW_mm1iBI), but I am unable to save a file as a .svg from SketchUp.  I downloaded the right extension (http://simonbeard.github.io/sketchup-svg-outline-plugin/) and everything seems to work until I actually try to save the file, then nothing happens.  Am I doing something wrong?

Take a look in your Documents folder. It's likely there's an svg file there, not where you asked for it to be saved. That's the behavior in Windows anyway.

Did you ever find a solution to this?  I am experiencing the same issue with sketchup 2017.  It's definitely not exporting to an svg, I did a full search of the c drive.

Are you selecting a face? I haven't had much luck selecting a path and getting it to export.

Thanks for the suggestion and response, but it turns out I needed the newest version of the plugin located at https://github.com/JoakimSoderberg/sketchup-svg-outline-plugin called sketchup-svg-outline-plugin-v1.2.rbz to work in sketchup 2017.  There is an old forum thread here that still points to the original plugin.

Yeah I think that's Hannah's. I responded with Joakim's version in that thread but it's easy to mix them up.

Can we go in and change the erroneous link? Since it's early in the thread it could plague us forever...

Wiki seems like a better place for that sort of information

I can't edit it, but I'll see if I can delete and re-post with the correct link.

And yes, it should be represented on the Wiki as well.
