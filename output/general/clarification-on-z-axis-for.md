## Clarification on Z-Axis for Beta Testers
Posted on **2017-02-01 16:22:45** by **tmaker**:

Hello,

In your latest update you said:

"If you are a Beta Tester: we aren’t certain we’ll receive the parts for the z-axis in time to ship them in the same box as your kit. If this turns out to be the case, we will ship you a second box with the z-axis parts for no extra charge as soon as we get all the necessary parts in stock (which should be very shortly after the kits ship)."

Can you clarify if beta testers will automatically receive the z-axis parts?  From the above it sounds like it might be included in the beta tester kit.  Or do beta testers need to purchase the z-axis parts when they're available on the site?

Thank you,

Tommy

Thanks for asking for us to clarify. It's not automatically included, but if you order a z-axis it will ship for free.

So the clarification is that the Beta-Testing of Maslow won't include testing of the Z unless we purchase it on top of the Beta cost? From the KS, I was definitely under the assumption that it was to be included as part of being a Beta-Tester.

Hey matthewrr sorry for the confusion. The z-axis wasn't actually built until after the kickstarter campaign was launched. The community asked for it so I made it. Basically it was a response to the community. I wish I had realized how much everyone wanted a z-axis before the campaign so I could have included it. We're doing our best to add the features you ask for so I would expect more optional add-ons in the future.

Any idea when you hope to have it listed so we can procure it for Beta?
