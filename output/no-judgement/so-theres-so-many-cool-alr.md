## So, theres so many cool already made designs.

I keep seeing a pattern, literally every design I see is downloaded in a DXF format, so I upload them to sketchup and I have the correct updated add on converter for SVG in sketchup, but Im not seeing any results. Also, Im having a hard time uploading them GC, GC will recognize SVG only?

I am getting my designs from Atfab, or Creative Commons. Also, Im on a mac, if that helps.

Agreed, seems like DXF is what most CNC files are saved in.

DXF is the most common file format by far, but most of the free and easy to use gcode generators (like www.makercam.com) use SVG files because SVG files are easier to work with. 

Ground Control reads gcode files which are the industry standard that almost all CNC routers use. 

To generate gcode files from a .DXF file I recommend HeeksCAD or converting .DXF to .SVG with QCAD (http://qcad.org/en/).

It's a little frustrating. Most of the good software to work with DXF files costs more than Maslow :-(

Just a little trivia, I worked my way through college as a CAD guy. DXF is the great equalizer dwg and other formats have ex-refs and layers exporting to DXF eliminates all doubt as to what you are importing.
