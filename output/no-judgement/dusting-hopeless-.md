## Dusting Hopeless ;-)

Don't be to concerned if you see reports about an unexplained sudden duststorm that led to the closure of aviation on 5 major airports in the Middle East.
I was just cleaning my Maslow vacum...
This bings me to the point where I would like to know if anyone knows a company selling a combination of dust and 'Glue-Fume' mask and ships internationaly.
I will give those DIY cyclone bins from YouBooze a try, plus will prepeare a draft for the Safty First Wiki. Nothing is more valuble then health.

I made a DIY cyclone from buckets and it works well.

Gero, whenever I'm concerned about dust or fumes I go for my 3M full face respirator.  It seems like overkill, but....in my opinion that is a good thing in this case.

Thanks @rancher, as a German overkill is never an issue for me. Rather safe then sorry. Will try to find a company that ships here and put what ever that budget is on top of my list,

I've had good luck with a dust collector like this: https://www.harborfreight.com/13-gallon-industrial-portable-dust-collector-31810.html

I still need to sweep the floor, but it sucks up the really fine dust and makes the space more livable. The bag is a lot easier to empty than a shop-vac and gets clogged less often

Gero, you want one of these spectacle kits.

  The earpiece on regular glasses will break the face seal and you will fog.

Wow, lots of learning the weekend. Thanks again! Bookmarked for further investigation :-)

@Bar, thanks. Don't think it will be available here and shipping might cost a fortune. Seen some YouBooze videos about building you own, including a guy that in the first version, made it tear itself apart, so built a second version. The Maslow can cut the parts.

There is no overkill in protection ;-)

Use personal protective equipment (PPE)

Protect your body by wearing appropriate PPE like safety glasses and earplugs. When handling materials, wear gloves and if you've got them, steel toed boots.

Cutting materials like MDF, Plywood and treated wood can expose you to various health risks like micro particles and toxic fumes.
Make sure you have your area sufficiently ventilated and wear protective gear. The minimum protection is a dust-mask. For your health there is no overkill, so depending on the conditions you are working in, a full face mask with dust and fume filtering might be appropriate.
A good protection is to research on the specific material you are cutting. Staring points for the research are pages like:

Wearing gloves without elaborating further is disputable... A NoGo for all spinning tools that are running. To carry your stuff, OK.

I have the big dust collectors from harbor freight both with 21 gallon trash can first stages and one with a Wynn canister filter and the other with a 1 micron aftermarket bag. Also a big ambient dust collector with Wynn filters. Since I set up the dust collector and the ambient collector in the basement I can hardly tell I work with wood in there anymore, and the other dust collector helps keep the garage clean. 

There is a shopvac sized cyclone and that and a real HEPA filter would be miles better than a shopvac alone.
