## Schematic on  GitHub
Posted on *2017-06-02 09:32:08* by *1996_donzi*

Can someone help? The schematic picture on the electronics github page is not the schematic that is in the eagle file when down loaded. What one is correct?

The eagle file will be more up to date, the picture should  be generated from the eagle file. Thanks for letting me know that the picture needs to be updated. Feel free to update with a pull request if you'd like!

Thank you for you response.  I'm not to familiar with github so I was not sure hot to approach it.
