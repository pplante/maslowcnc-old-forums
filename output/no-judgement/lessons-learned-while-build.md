## Lessons learned while building the frame

I know Bar is working on the documenting “Step 7: Building The Frame”, but I’ll share things that I noted while building it that might help others.



1. I should have taken pictures during the process and kept a written log.



2. Don’t forget to cut dog bones for the motor mounts on Arm_Back.svg and Arm_Front.svg. The files could be modified to incorporate dog bones.



3. Document usable dimensions for making cuts while on temporary frame. I attempted to cut a part out too high on the plywood sheet and the chain skipped a few teeth.



4. Include an optional step in the chain calibration instructions to paint the link at 12’o'clock after calibration is complete. It was a quick fix when the chain skipped teeth.



5. When building the legs, assemble the angle braces at the top after completing the bottom part of the leg to ensure the plywood spill-board will have complete contact with the bottom and top of the leg.  Picture attached to illustrate.  [LegDiagram](../../images/eX/iP/eXiP_legdiagram.jpg.jpg) 



6. The “Calibrate Motors” function can resolve issues with the motors not turning. After moving to th e new frame, the motor on the right did not move when jogging the position within Groundcontrol; however it would move successfully using the “Test Motors” function and also with the test electronics firmware. After running the calibrate motors function, the motor on the right started working correctly. 



7. Brainstorm with others on overhead umbilical cable system for the router power, z motor and dust collection. I’m currently using an overhead retractable power outlet to keep the cables from getting tangled.



I'm still amazed how well it works and the simplicity in the design. A few friends were surprised that I could even cobble it together and turn out good cuts ;) Now they are lining up to use it.

I added a 2x4 across both back braces  directly behind the backer 4x8 ply on 'leg piece #3'.  The 2x4  was screwed onto leg piece #3 with the  4 side down and 2 side against the plywood.  It took the bow out of the plywood in the middle.  I added one higher on the back braces, like above or in place of 'leg piece #1',  to do the same thing up top.  We might add these two 2x4x8s for backer plywood to keep it square.
