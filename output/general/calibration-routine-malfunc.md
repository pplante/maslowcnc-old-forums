## Calibration routine malfunction
Posted on **2017-06-16 09:44:41** by **blsteinhauer88**:

With the latest fw/GC my sled is having trouble finding center, I have an error ring and it just climbs the board.  I decided to Wipe the eprom, reload the FW and calibrate like new.  When I get the the first step to align the gear, the left motor will move 1degree, but the right motor turns about a full turn of the gear.   I cannot align the gear to finish the steps.

yes, reloaded and confirmed, it turns the right motor one full turn, not one degree.

I see that problem with the error ring as well.

I started an issue report in GC

What's the current status here?  I checked the threads in Github, but can't tell if I should spend the time trying to calibrate and cut a project today, or wait a bit longer.  Are we up?

From the Linux side I can tell that I have 2 failed attemts to calibrate today with FW0.76 and GC0.76 with minus values for motor spacing and vertical offset. Would be nice to know if this is only me again :-)

I'm getting nervous, isn't the final product supposed to ship in a couple of weeks and there are still issues calibrating it? Seems like shipping product that is not 100% ready would result in tons of support requests and wasted time. I know in my business it does. Better to perhaps delay shipments till this is all worked out?

Don't be nervous this was with FW 73 [IMG_0033](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:Z4d3:img_0033.jpg.jpg)

That's nice!  Wait, so it's working?  I keep reading about legs being cut off and stuff, and dropped code.  I am ready to cut some projects but have been waiting on the current bugs to be resolved.  So....it works?

Use Fw 73 and the latest GC and you will be fine!  He is fixing FW 76 now!

That sign is beautiful!



I *think* I've got a fix for the calibration issue with FW 76 up, and we're hot on the trail of the missing serial characters (if that's not a Hardy Boys book title, it should be)

That sign went all wrong! Just look at the spacing on the tractor tires! ðŸ˜› Awesome work! can't wait to get my machine!

blsteinhauer88 What software are u using to make those signs?

---

Posted on **2017-07-06 22:51:48** by **blsteinhauer88**:

@rollandelliott I got the pattern from cnc dfx site, https://cncdxffiles.com/

Then I used illustrator to convert to svg, then I used Easel to clean up the design so that Maslow can cut it with a .062 or 1/16 bit.
