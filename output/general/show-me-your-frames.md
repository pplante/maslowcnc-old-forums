Hey everybody! Bar told me he's been really impressed with the different machine frames Beta testers have constructed in the past few weeks, so I wanted to feature some of those in the update! If you've got a frame and are open to having me share photo(s) of it in the update, please post your pictures here so I can show you off tomorrow.

Thanks!
hannah

@mattnelson did you use the temporary frame to cut those?  they are perfect looking, I had drift and odd parts from an earlier version of GC.

@blsteinhauer88, no I cut them out at my local makerspace, Fresno Ideaworks.  I also used a $50 sheet of maple plywood and spent a lot of time on the sander.
