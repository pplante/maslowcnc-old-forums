## Motor specifications
Posted on *2017-02-07 11:04:44* by *kiwimaker*

Hi, I'm trying to source my own parts and feel that my motors do not have enough torque. 
Does anyone know the make and model or the specifications (RPM and torque) of the drive motors?

Bar wrote in the "Motor Direction and sign convention" thread  "I don't recall exactly of the top of my head, but I believe they are in the 30kg-cm torque range at about 30 rpm."

Bar also had written in another thread that the motors he is using had to be custom made along with the encoder.

Maybe this will help you as well.
Bar also wrote in "Motor life expectancy and feed rate" thread "I've been running my motors every day for about 4 months now with no issues, so I would expect them to last quite awhile. Because of the 300:1 reduction gearbox with a worm gear, the motors aren't really working that hard and stay cool even after hours of running. We will make them available as a replacement part so when they do wear out, they will be available."

I can't really add much except to say that another month of running them every day without issue :)

So you would have a motor need of :
(1) worm drive gear reduction at about
(2)  30 RPM and at least
(3)  30kg-Cm torque
(4) some way of adding an encoder.
It is most likely to need at least 12 Vdc although 24vdc should also work.
