I have made several large tabletops and taken hours to woodburn drawings onto them, just like the pen tool thats been discussed I could make a huge use for a woodburner attatchment, possibly even a dremel attatchment not for cutting but for artwork type stuff.

Those are beautiful, that's some serous patience. 



You could absolutely attach either a woodburner or a dremel.
