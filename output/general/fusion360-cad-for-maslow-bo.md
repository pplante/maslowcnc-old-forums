Mornin' gang.  I made you another thing.  Holy crap, the audio is atrocious.  My laptop sounds like a helicopter!  I also make a lot of mistakes, but hopefully you can learn how to do it better than me.

Hope it's helpful.  It's certainly long.

Nice! If you have an external microphone, I find something like this [USB Audio Jack](https://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-External-Adapter-Windows-AU-MMSA/dp/B00IRVQ0F8/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1493137957&sr=1-3&keywords=usb+audio+adapter) works pretty good, and cheap. A quality microphone is never a bad investment. Your not kidding about that fan noise :)

You have no idea, I'm an audio snob so I can't believe I'm posting videos that sound this terrible.  I just put on my list to bring up some gear from the studio to the cabin here.

Super cool. You used that user parameter of "Thickness" for the stock, it seems you could also use a user parameter of "Tool Radius" to take into account the amount of cut you're going to get - it feels like that would be important when you're making tabs like that.
