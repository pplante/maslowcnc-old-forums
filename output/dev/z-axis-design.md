## Z-Axis design?

Could you tell us a little bit about the automatic Z-Axis that you have in the works? Will it still work with most fixed-base routers? Any pictures or prototypes?

Good question. The parts are in the mail so I should have pictures of at least a first pass at a prototype in the next week. The way I am aiming to make it work is that I have a motor/gearbox/encoder combo similar to the ones which move the router except smaller. The gear box will adjust the height on the router by connecting to the shaft where the adjustment knob is. 

I chose a gearbox with an output shaft which is off center which will allow space for the motor to attach to as many types of routers as possible, but I don't think it's possible to make it work with every router. I chose to recommend the Ridgid R2200 with this in mind because it is a particularly good candidate for attaching a motor to. I didn't expect the z-axis to be so important to so many people. :-)

A big part of the reason I didn't include it with the kit and bump the kit price up a little is that there are so many router designs out there and I wanted everyone to be able to use the one they already have. I think the big barriers to entry to getting more people involved in CNC are cost and intimid ation and so I wanted to make the machine as simple and cheap as possible, I think I underestimated how many of our community members already have experience with other CNC machines. 

Long story short, the z-axis is clearly a priority for a lot of people so it's a priority for me. Expect pictures of a prototype asap.

Good to hear, thanks. I do a lot of pure profile cuts, but at least half of my projects do pockets of some sort. Having an auto-Z seems like it would take this a long way towards doing 95% of my projects at home  rather than the shop, without a lot of time hacking around with the router in between cutting paths.
