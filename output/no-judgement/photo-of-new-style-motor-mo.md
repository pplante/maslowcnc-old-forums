## photo of new style motor mount?

can someone post a photo of the new motor mount (the one mounted directly on the 2x4) with the chain on.. I saw a picture where it looked like the chain was routed around a little wheel. I badly need my chain to stop slipping.

[Here](/images/vk/vk6m_img_0587.jpg.jpg) is mine. I used a screw and a short piece of tubing to make the fairlead. Use _lots_ of screws to affix the mount to the 2x4 - I started with 3 and found that it twisted.
