## Pen Plotting
Posted on **2016-11-05 20:01:15** by **cadcoke5**:

When I saw the video, I was quite impressed with the quality of the cut.  All the "Draw Bots" out there built like this, have very wiggly lines.  Perhaps the mass of the router helps. But, reading the messages here, is also sounds like you are doing some other software work to compensate for things like chain sag, and other issues that perhaps the other draw-bots are not considering.

Of course, this machine would be able to plot a drawing with a pen, by simply substituting a pen holder for the router. Consider adding a simple way to do that.  It may just be a place on the existing holder to hold a pen, and your software can be set to compensate for the new position.  Or alternatively, a new head entirely.

I've been thinking about picking up one of these: http://www.widgetworksunlimited.com/CNC_Plotter_Pen_Bit_Thick_Line_p/cnc-pltr_pen_thick.htm

It's a little bit pricey for a sharpie, but it's a drop in solution

Thanks for sharing that link. Seems like a nice solution and isn't that expensive compared to sharpies when you look at the replacement tips (sure it's a little more expensive, but seems fair for a custom solution like this).  

The biggest limitation here is lack of different pen types.   A custom solution that replaces the full router and is accommodating of any pen would be nice.  In theory it would be easier to make something that is accepted into the router, but I think many pens would be too long for that to work well.

I'm sure I can live with just the pens you linked to though so I'll probably just go with those.  It will make xmas ornaments with little faces drawn on them super easy.

Dang! You stole my idea! I was going to install a pen and see what kind of art Maslow can create. :)

How about making the wood base the router attaches to have a second "mount" spot specifically for penal? It would be well off center from the router, and would need a setting in software to compensate. No need to remove router this way
