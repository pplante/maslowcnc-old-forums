## Free? CAD

Someone posted this as as a comment https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/mechanical-software and I think it looks pretty interesting. I haven't downloaded it yet or played around with it too much but from what I can tell from watching youtube videos it looks like a toned down version of SolidWorks which could be pretty cool.

The UI (based on a few minutes watching video, so YMMV) looks more like Sketchup.  My biggest concern is that since it's offered for free, but is still commercial, the users could be left high and dry if the company folds or changes their terms of use.  Still, it looks like nice software.

I'd rather just use Fusion 360 since I don't think Autodesk is going to fold any time soon...
