## Z-Axis idea

I know you're looking at motorizing the plunge/height setting on the router, but reading another post mentioning a "tri-pod" cable made me think of the old "remote shutter" release cables on cameras. A flexible "push/pull" cable where the outer housing is clamped and the inner rod moves the remote end. (I hope that makes sense).



Wonder about a setup like that (a bit larger) so that the motor for the z-axis could be "remote" from the actual router, and then just a cable that pushes up/down at the router that the motor actuates.



Probably more complexity for little gain, but I was just trying to make it more adaptable for any router setup.



Just a thought...

There are several reasons why one might want to move the device that causes a motion or action to a different place. Could be weight, speed (by reducing mass), environment (chemicals or gasses), or insufficient space.



For example in model airplanes one goal is to move weight forward, because all weight added behind the center of gravity must be balanced by weight in front of the CG. Its very common to mount the servos that control the tail surfaces far forward. Then there are several different mechanical techniques to connect the servo to the tail surface it controls.



The main drawbacks of moving the motor away from the part it controls is that it adds more parts that might fail, and usually adds a level of slop/inaccuracy to the system.



It's an interesting idea but I don't think qualifies for any of the usual reasons.

the weight of the z-axis motor is trival compared to the rest of the sled.



remember that we add bricks to the sled to get enough weight there, so with this design, we aren't looking to make things lighter.

Thanks jbarchuk... I see your point.



davidlang - I wasn't really aiming for weight savings (although I guess it would, but as you say, it isn't needed). I was aiming for "fit more routers with same device" as it seems some have a hard time getting the servo in there.



Anyway, was just an "off the wall idea" I thought I would toss out in case it helped anybody any.
