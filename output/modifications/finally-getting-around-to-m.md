## Finally getting around to my new sled design
Posted on **2017-05-14 16:30:58** by **chadzimmerman**:

Yeah, I said a while ago that I was working on a design that would let you use any router regardless of how the height is adjusted. 



In between other projects today. I got the z axis mount cut out and put together. The z axis carriage is in the works, I have to deviate from the design I have as is is not wide enough for the average router body of 3.5". 



Here is what is done so far.

I may end up redesigning the sled base though. Will know when I have it all together.

Interesting will this let one use palm routers?

Yes, you would be able to mount palm routers, dremel tools, pens and even a laser assembly.  I am using the designs from the hobby CNC plans I have, they need some adjustments though. The sizing of the router carriage doesn't allow for a full size router.  I will scale it up to work this week.

Thoughts today at work. With this z axis design, it "could" make the sled tip happy at the top. So I am also pondering moving the assembly to the top with the router facing down. 



I am milling the z axis roller supports this week.. Have to order roller skate bearings for it though.



I did work out the clamp with for a full sized router, so should cover any that someone would use. Would just have to adjust the diameter to their router. 



I am planning on 3" of travel, more than most would need I think.

realistically 1-2" of travel is probably enough. the maslow is really designed to cut sheet stock, and you will seldom use anything thicker than 3/4", wanting to cut all the way through 2x4s would require you have 1.5" of travel.

You have not seen some of my slab Lumber then ;)   but you are correct, 90% of the users will not need much travel.

I have a collection of aged scaffolding planks that I would like to torture with the Maslow. Yes, planing and cutting through. A matter of bit length puls z-travel.

Ok, I have skateboard bearings on the way, making use of one of the mills at work to machine the axis bearing slides. 



My daughter is going to weld me a couple of antibacklash mounts (if you are going to engineer.. Over engineer). 



I just have to re-run the z-axis support.. I must have had my table saw fence slightly askew.. My 90Â° point did not stay 90 all the way up. Will also get the x-axis cradle button this weekend.. I hope. I should have a testable version next week.. Just need my maslow to test it ;) 



If this works as I hope it will, it should open up a whole slew of new options.

Gave my daughter a project for school tomorrow. Welding the drive nut to the mounting bracket.  [20170518_203515](../../images/a7/c0/a7c0_20170518_203515.jpg.jpg)

Assembled pieces.  She did a nice job with them.  [20170519_161013](../../images/XT/vg/XTvg_20170519_161013.jpg.jpg)

The good and bad of building a prototype out of scraps of wood.. Reusing what I have.. But having to deal with warping and twists. 



Besides that, making some good progress today. I am close to the limit I can do till I get the cut bearing assembly pieces and assemble them. 



Anyway, some more teaser photos.

Taller assembly is the z axis support and motor mount. Smaller assembly holds the router.

I see you're looking to use s skateboard bearings. It's that for friction between the sled and the material or for some other purpose? I've had two ideas for sled/material friction reduction. The first would be to use flange mount ball transfers like these: https://www.mcmaster.com/#ball-transfers/=17q1j44



The other idea would be to use an air cushion (think air hockey).

---

Posted on **2017-05-21 08:31:58** by **chadzimmerman**:

That is for the X axis to ride up and down on.  For friction reduction I am going with a thin sheet of plastic on the underside. 



Later modifications will be to ditch the sled entirely and go to a gantry system.  That is a later problem to work out.  I will have a better idea once I have my Maslow running.

you mean z axis, not x axis :-)

Posted on **2017-05-21 17:40:19** by **chadzimmerman**:

Yeah, yeah :p  I will switch to "uppy downy thing" then.

I goofed on one of the 4" rollers.. Need to redrill the holes. But this setup rides very smoothly.

I bet it does! Cool design.

Posted on **2017-05-23 17:05:24** by **davidlang**:

I did that on my first CNC, but when I rebuilt it, I went with makerslide and all-metal wheels

Posted on **2017-05-24 08:29:37** by **chadzimmerman**:

I am looking to keep costs down though.  I have looked at that material for building the maslow frame.



Bar, I may have a working demo this weekend.  But full testing will have to wait till I get my Maslow. :)

---

Posted on **2017-05-24 09:01:07** by **davidlang**:

I understand keeping the costs down, but I found the hassles in keeping that angle/bearing setup snug was annoying enough that I found the difference t be well worth it overall. but in this case, since it's only the Z axis (which doesn't move that much) it may end up being acceptable.

---

Posted on **2017-05-24 12:53:19** by **chadzimmerman**:

Yeah, it is only ~6" of travel.  Now, when I start looking into the gantry setup.  Makerslide is the option I may go with to build the gantry.. that is for later :)

---

Posted on **2017-05-24 13:13:39** by **davidlang**:

6" of travel is actually a lot for this machine, double what you need. But check that before you cut anything down, with this approach things eat up travel quickly.

---

Posted on **2017-05-24 14:19:13** by **chadzimmerman**:

It is a lot since it is based on another cnc design I was going to build before Maslow came along.  But you also have to remember, I am moving the entire spindle instead of just the cutter.

---

Posted on **2017-05-24 14:48:46** by **davidlang**:

the standard maslow Z axis moves the entire motor, so they are pretty close to the same (if you take the motor out of the base, they are equivalent)

Tired thinking.. You are right.. My z is just router independent version
