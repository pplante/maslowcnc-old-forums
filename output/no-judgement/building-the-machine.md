## Building the machine

I looked at the files for the arms and motor mounts on the source page which leads me to the SVG files. Currently on my machine i have autocad creo and inventor none of which seem to like that file format. I am wondering do i have to download sketchup (is it even free?) to get the dimensions for the cuts?

Sketchup is the editor/viewer for *.skp files. It's excellent for viewing and for editing has a pretty good set of features.. Don't hesitate to install it.

SVG is a standard format for 2D vector graphics and is very portable.



If you want to edit SVG files, I would recommend Inkscape on the PC.



Whatever program you intend to use to make toolpaths will import the SVG file. If you're just starting out, I recommend makercam.com

No no no. Just go to Fusion 360. Easy as pie, especially if you have inventor skills. SketchUp is not the go, not for anyone looking for versatility and growth anyways! Please forget / ignore all the suggestions out there...use Fusionn360!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously!!!!  Don't waste your time with anything else!!!!! Believe me, I'm Australian!! SketchUp is NOT the go! Fusion 360 IS the best software out there. Don't be fooled, don't be misled, don't be wasting your time learning anything else! Fusion 360! Get it! Use it!

I'm confused about the arms and mounts too.  I used Fusion to look at them, (P.S. Spatial Guy, trying to get F360 to open an SVG is anything but easy as pie!), but I don't understand how that's going to help make the machine when it needs to be built still.  Should I go start cutting out these parts by hand?

Bar wote in the comments of Kickstarter : "@Michael Owen Next week's update will have preliminary assembly instructions, but here's the quick version. We're hoping to do one better than send you plans. The way the assembly works is that you attach the motors to two corners of a sheet of plywood and then the machine cuts out it's own parts to build the whole frame. The accuracy isn't as good as the full version, and you have to hold the router to keep it stable, but it works well enough that you don't need any other tools or plans to build your machine. Like I said, next week's update will have details."

Thank you Tom.

Even Autodesk wouldn't hire an old disabled Aussie Tom...lol. 



Just tired of the endless 'which software' debate when I have no doubt that new users should start with Fudion 360, and the majority of existing CAD users should be using Fusion 360.



I just want to get rid of any confusion for users and potential users. Use Fusion 360.

I tried using both inkscape and makercam wasnt to impressed with either though i do see makercam being useful to export gcode. Does fusion360 export its own gcode to be able to use that as an all in one?

---

Posted on **2017-03-12 18:18:45** by **rancher**:

It does.  I was able to make a design from scratch and output gcode for it with only a little swearing.

Rancher, which post option did you choose to output the toolpaths in G code? There's some question about which selection to make since there doesn't seem to be an obvious, generic "G Code" selection but instead machine-specific choices.

Thank you!  I used "HAAS-generic".

@TomTheWhittler basically nailed it (thanks!), but I just want to confirm that he's right. This week's update will have all the details about how the machine cuts out it's own parts, but the basic version is that you mount the motors directly to a sheet of plywood and it operates with a somewhat limited work area to cut out it's own parts. We didn't want to assume that everyone has other tools like a jig saw and having the machine build itself seemed like the solution.



Everyone has heard of the early 3D printers which could self replicate, but I'm not sure if anyone has done one which builds itself from scratch! :-)

Sounds kind of creepy, machines building more machines that build more machines...

@spacialguy, we've been on that treadmill for a century or more. Most of the common machines today could not have been built at any cost a few decades ago.



Most of the 'cheap junk from the fa east' would have been high-precision parts not that long ago.



it's most obvious in electronics, but even in traditional machinery where the precision of the resulting equipment hasn't increased that much, the cost of getting that precision has been plummeting because things that used to be horribly labor intensive have shifted to mass production (and no, simply shifting production to lower wage countries doesn't account for the price drop)

I've always loved the "Connecticut Yankee" type stories, and the good ones show the need to build the machines to build the machines ... to build what you want. If you like this sort of thing, look for the 1632 series of books started by Eric Flint. In it a 1999 West Virginia town gets transplanted into 1630s Germany, they are up to 29 or so novels and hundreds, if not thousands of short stories now, with many almost scholarly articles on technology

Thanks David, I'll check it out. That's only 150 years before 'Australia' was invaded and stolen from the native people by the British. 



(As a quick aside... I often find myself amazed when I look around...239 years ago there were nomadic tribes and virgin land. No wheel, no metal or glass, not one sheep, horse, cow, rabbit, fox, cat etc...the tribes did not cultivate anything, just moved where there was naitive bush food available and ate native animals. 17 years ago we hosted the Olympics for the second time... There were approximately 800,000 aborigines in 1788  when the British arrived. By 1888 there were about 60,000...I wish they had technology to fight back with, but they weren't inclined to fight, not even amongst themselves.)
