Is [this](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/wiki/Ground-Control-Users-Guide) the page you're looking for? There has been some updating in the documentation today that might caused the change.

I think this was my fault, I've swept through the whole wiki this weekend and merged or tossed some duplicate pages. If I discarded something unique, please let me replace it, but I'm pretty sure I just cleaned things up, with no losses.

My wife refers to this sort of thing as “moving the cheese“, I just see it as documentation housekeeping. A necessary task with occasional impacts like this :)
