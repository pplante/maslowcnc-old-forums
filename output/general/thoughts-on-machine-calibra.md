## thoughts on machine calibration
Posted on *2017-06-30 19:19:52* by *davidlang*

First off, I'll point out that I haven't built one yet.

Since we now have a temporary sled that's built from a template instead of measurements, can we just put in a measurement for the width of the temporary sled mounts instead of going through the calibration step to tweak it by experimentation?

Then if the temporary sled is accurate, can that drill the holes for the permanent sled accurately enough to be able to get away with skipping the calibration on the final machine?
