## A wiki?
Posted on **2017-02-13 11:36:51** by **Bar**:

I'd like to set up a wiki page as a collected repository of information from the community. I think it would be valuable to have pages to list:

1) The pros and cons of different routers along with basic information like shaft size
2) The pros and cons of different CAD/CAM software
3) Running Ground Control on different hardware

Does anyone have a recommendation for a wiki host which we could use? From looking around I couldn't find anything I liked at all, but I'm sure I'm missing something.

Any suggestions of where I should look?

Anyone have any thoughts on Miraheze? (https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Miraheze)

They look like they are inline with our goals.

Any ETA on this?

ourproject.org is another alternative. I haven't used either of them.  But you might look there too.

I've got a plan. 

I played around with a bunch of the options out there but I don't really want to force everyone make another account somewhere. I think the best way to do it is to use the wiki built into GitHub. 

We're using GitHub for our revision control and issue tracking already so having an account there makes sense. The only thing which is weird about the GitHub wiki system is that each repository has it's own wiki page so there is one for software, one for firmware, one for electronics and one for mechanics. I changed the names of the PCB and CAD repositories to reflect their broader roles as repositories for all things mechanical and electrical which I thought made more sense. 

You can edit the wiki for the routers right now here: https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki

@Bar, can you add a link to the wiki among the links at the top of the Maslow home page? :)

Yes, good idea.

That was quick!  :) Unfortunately it seems the link is broken... :(

@Bar, it looks  like the wiki link needs 'http://gith' added to the beginning...

Dummies question :-o
To add a router on the wiki, do i click "edit" or "new page"?

---

Posted on **2017-02-17 04:31:30** by **scottsm**:

Yes, that's it.

Will image url's from my dropbox work?
If i put the link in the browser i get "login/singup" or "no thanks" before i see the image

Sorry for bothering, found the answer, looks like it will work generating a "static url".

Now I prepared the specs of my Bosh and was ready to upload, then I read "collection of routers tested and recommended by the community"
 I have not tested it nor do I recommend it. Shall I upload anyway, as a reference?

My vote would be "yes, but note that it isn't tested or recommended". The information you've gathered might be useful to someone else and it can be removed if folks decide that it's against policy to have untested units listed.

I vote yes too. The more information we have the better. Thanks for adding!

Thanks for the approval. I should have studied how to format on Github first. Feel free to delete any time.

Hey that wiki link on the site menu bar is still broken, it's currently pointing to `ub.com/Maslow...`

Thanks for the heads up!

Posted on **2017-02-21 10:41:15** by **Bar**:

I believe it is fixed now. Thanks again for letting me know!
