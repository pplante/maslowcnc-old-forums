## Forum Reorganization

Hello, All!



I'm re-organizing posts a bit to help with the eventual "hey, remember that post..." that's going to crop up one day! The Technical Details Channel is intended to be a place to discuss Maslow in its current form, rather than modifications to it or suggestions for new uses, etc...



Those kinds of discussions will be moved the new "Modifications" channel Bar set up today.



So if you're looking to learn more about Maslow in its current form, this is the place to do that. If you have a suggestion for an improvement to Maslow, that goes in Modifications.



If you feel I've moved one of your posts erroneously, drop me a private message and we can talk it through.
