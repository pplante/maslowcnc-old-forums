## Be safe!

As if high speed router bits and talk of lasers and plasma cutters wasn't enough, the materials we're cutting could be very heavy and that's no treat for the back...



I highly recommend one of these contraptions for lugging 4x8 material around; I've been using one for years when I sheetrock and for the investment, it's a major back saver!

The Gorilla grippers are nice too; I've used one but they're kinda pricey. This one is under $10.

That's a really cool invention!

I'll second the value of this tool, I've been a user for years. Mine is hanging on my frame...

I bet you could make one on your Maslow CNC (though they're cheap enough at the big box stores that it may not be worth the effort).

@jwolter0, that is a fantastic idea

I should read the forum before going to the Maslow-Room. Turning the test sheet around on my own, I almost cut off my toes tonight. Was just pure luck, as I am wearing rubber sandals. I was also lucky that the 3 cables (router, vacuum, Z-Axis) seem to have got no damage.

Yeah, be careful moving plywood around. It's heavy and awkward to move on your own.

How about a 'Safety first' Page page. That could also include that the Maslow is not something that you let you kids unpack and test on Christmas eve, while you finish the turkey.

It's so easy to get complacent. I cut myself last week on chisel I had been using to scrape paint out of a stubborn area. I was thinking "I've been scraping paint... it can't possibly be sharp" and pulled the bonehead "use my finger to test sharpness" trick.

+1 for the "Safety First" page

---

Posted on **2017-04-25 12:08:29** by **Bar**:

I'll make it right now

It's up [here](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Safety-First), what are we missing?

I always wear eye protection around a router. I had a spiral bit break one time and embed itself into my arm... my eye would not have fared as well.

Also, routers are loud, particularly with certain cutting bits. I also always wear ear protection.

Great suggestions! Do you want to add them, or should I?

Oh! Duh... I always forget that's a wiki site. Yes, I'll take care of it.

---

Posted on **2017-04-25 12:35:04** by **Bar**:

Haha, yeah it's a little unconventional to have everything as a wiki

---

Posted on **2017-04-25 12:41:59** by **Bar**:

Looks great! I like your additions!

Posted on **2017-04-25 12:42:30** by **TheRiflesSpiral**:

Thanks, Bar!

I took a look at the page and I can't think of anything to add.  On the topic of panel carriers, here's an interesting review on 3 very different designs.

Ask, before using your partners sewing machine pulleys!  [IMAG0669](../../images/nu/qA/nuqA_imag0669.jpg.jpg) 

They make nice chain guides, but get permission first!

Cables running under the base was the second thing I was concerned after my toes survived. All got a hit and survived, but I am thinking of a sort of protection channel.

Bobbins! Awesome, gero! I think I've seen some metal ones also... might hold up a little longer.

@Bar I've added 'Cut the power if something seems wrong'. Kindly review and correct.

I like it :-)
