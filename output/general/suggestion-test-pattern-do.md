## Suggestion: Test Pattern double-duty/future uses
Posted on **2017-06-05 10:54:38** by **mrfugu**:

Hello, (Post Kickstarter) Maslow Purchaser here, haven't received my Maslow, new to CNC, 1/2 decent hobbyist woodworker.  

I have a suggestion that seems logical to me and might provide additional functionality to Maslow down the line. 

I propose including a calibration pattern (if it's needed) across a full sized sheet that could double as the final stand/work surface,  by use of a test pattern that is designed to allow 'standard' wood clamps to reach in through the back of the stand in order to easily hold a non-standard (or non full sized) piece of plywood firm to the surface. 

I see future applications possible such as making GC aware of where a clamp is located, and avoiding/alerting to them, or a rudimentary vacuum-table by taking a split off of the dust collection system. 

Obviously, the need for a simple test/calibration pattern is most likely primary, but it seems that with a little foresight, Maslow could be made (by default) to work with a much wide r size of panels, using tools most woodworkers already have easily at hand.

either way, its an Awesome project so far, I can't wait to get building. 

Cheers

The origin of this idea is to try to get the most out of a single sheet of ply. I imagine that many of us would love to be able to maximize material use. By having Maslow attempt to account for the work surface and any of its possible flaws (clamps or other obstructions, work surface edges, limitations of the sled, various axis limitations, etc), it would be relatively easy to get the most out of the available material.

Hi @mrfugu. I am not sure I totally understand your approach. For the final calibration of the built frame, I love the idea to have something created with it. Since I have the Maslow running, I wanted a stand to rest the sled on, for tool changes or other adjustments on the sled. For the Maslow to build itself a frame and sled, with the temporary mounts and sled, the sheet is already partially filled.
Cutting-Bit holders with a place for the oped-end wrench/spanner and the allankeys, so everything to tune and maintain the Maslow, are other things that come to my mind in combining a testpattern with a usable result. Thanks for sharing your idea.

HI @gero, I was trying to figure out a method for (reliably and securely and cheaply) securing pieces of ply to the Maslow stand/frame. Please remember that I don't yet have one. It occurred to me that it would be handy to able to clamp a 'less than whole' piece of ply to the Maslow stand/frame (using my standard 'home depot' clamps, the brand eludes me but your standard grip clamps with a trigger release, not the fancy ones with a twist screw as they tend to have a higher profile above the clamped surface on the unadjustable side. ). 

In order to do so would require that I: 

1) made a replacement 4'x8' piece for the Maslow that had holes in it sufficient to put a number of clamps through (approx 50-60mm circles, repeated at some interval would probably work easily)

2) made sure that the clamp did not interact with the sled/chain/router)

3) was able to easily communicate to GC that I was only interested in working on a subset of its total available work surface, 

While I was thinking about this, I was reading the forums about the Calibration shape, and how by machin ing the calibration shape at different locations on a full sized board in order to measure deflection/errors would  result in a fullsized piece of plywood that would (if intended) be suitable for passing clamps from back to front through the Maslow stand/frame (the portion that consists of a full sized 4x8 piece of ply. 

This led me into a Fusion360  session that looks an awful lot like the same pattern you'd see on a vacuum table, but lets put that that aside for now. 

I then postulated that it would benefit GC to be aware of not just the Maslow 'maximum work area' but specific work areas per job, which would allow for one to avoid obstructions the sled might encounter while in motion. (ie: the clamps sticking through from the back of the stand)

Its obvious to me that the project isn't quite at this point of complexity, but I'm sure once everyone has a few odd sized ~1/3 sheets of plywood in a heap in the corner, more people will begin thinking about some similar ideas.

We set 'Home' at the start of the cut, at any place on the sheet. For clamps all is needed to calculate that the diameter of the sled does not touch your clamps? I still don't fully get it but will try another brainstorm tomorrow.

like I said, I don't have one yet, so I'm probably overthinking things a bit.

a good way to hold material down is composite nails like https://ancofastenersales.com/product/raptor-f15/ you nail down through your workpiece and it won't damage your bit if you hit one. You can also knock the workpiece loose easily (a sharp blow sideways will snap these nails.

good call, thanks!

cool find @davidlang; that just got added to the "parts vendors" page on the wiki!
