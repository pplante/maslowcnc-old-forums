## PCP Layout
Posted on **2017-04-08 14:40:30** by **danieljames**:

Hi everyone. I'm really excited about Maslow and all the things I'm yet to design and create using this machine. I'm interested in learning about the electronics used to control the step motors. I came across the PCP layout in the wiki but I could'nt read the schematic values on the diagram. Is there a larger jpeg file available. I've made it my mission this year learn arduino and about the electronics that make projects work.  I can't wait to get my Maslow. Thanks Dan

I agree that the jpeg file is hard to read. I've printed it out to a pdf,  [MegaShield-schematic](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:0LN4:megashieldschematic.png.jpg) but you will be better able to learn if you use Eagle, the program the board was designed in. Some of the details overlap, and the program will let you zoom in or turn off some of them to see others. 
 Your mission is a big one, but will take you to lots of interesting projects!

Thanks a lot Scottsm. I'm going to use eagle for sure.
