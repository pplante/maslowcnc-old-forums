Hi, I purchased the Maslow CNC they are waiting our delivery details but we would also like to purchase the Z axis.

We are unsure of what router to purchase as the rigid one isn't available in the U.K.

Anyone got any ideas and what Z axis option we should choose for that particular router?

Many thanks

search for the topic EU and you will find several discussions on possible routers (I know this forum software discourages searching, but it's been covered several times), also see the wiki page on tested routers https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Tested-Routers-List
