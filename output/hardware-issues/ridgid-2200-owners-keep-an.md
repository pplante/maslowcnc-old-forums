## Ridgid 2200 owners keep an eye on your Z-axis

I learned tonight that the orange plastic goody that rides on the z-axis screw is a sacrificial item. The z-drive is more than powerful enough to chew the thread right off it. They're not expensive, but also not immediately available. There's enough meat left that I can carve a temporary thread to serve until a replacement arrives though.
 Next time I'm moving the sled around the workspace I'll release the latch and pull the motor back by hand instead of stacking up a few clicks on the z-out button to raise it then looking away for a moment.

I was afraid that this is going to happen since there are no "hard wired" safety limits. I can see the same thing happening of the router sled ramming into the chain gear because of a encoder failure or the start position getting lost.

I think we can add something similar to a limit switch by monitoring the motor torque. I expect it will create a measurable spike when the motor "hits" something. That's a little bit down the road because priorities 1 and 2 are get everyone cutting and then rewrite the feedback control system.

That will be a nice refinement. I fully agree on your priorities!

I agree on the priorities as well. Get everyone running first.
