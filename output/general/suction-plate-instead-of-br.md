## Suction plate instead of bricks?

I was wondering if anyone has tried to build a suction plate (by tapping the vacuum hose)? I was thinking this would offer a more stable travel for the router and stop any stuttering by tension

the bricks create tension in the chains, a vacuum would pull against the table.



you need the least amount of friction against the table and a vacuum would increase the friction against the table.
