## Quick release 4 swapping between 2 routers with different cutting bits?
Posted on **2017-07-17 06:09:56** by **rollandelliott**:

I'd like to swap between two routers with different bits and also some type of sharpie permanent marker spring loaded contraption. There are many ways to design a quick release system, but I'm wondering if anyone has any simple ways of accomplishing this.

I was thinking of making a plate for the router like the above drawing shows and putting two toggle bolts on each side of the sled to just flip up and pull out.

or maybe there is a quick release collet system for ridged router like porter cable makes.

The router motorss pull out of the Z axis shell from the rear/top, so if you have two Rigid 2200 you can just swap motors in a few seconds using the existing clamp.

Also will be making pen holder out if 3" pvc pipe with some 1/16 shims so it can slide right into router mount
