## Power Supply
Posted on **2017-03-31 13:12:44** by **neilmunro**:

What spec. do I need to fulfil for the power supply. Is a LED lighting transformer such as  http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/105w-low-voltage-lighting-transformer-nl48c   satisfactory?
Thanks
Neil

That one looks perfect! The 12volt supply only powers the motors so the stability of the voltage is not particularly critical. Almost any 12 volts supply will work.

I saw your issue (thank you for filing that) and I will update the directions to make it more clear.

Thanks Bar. Obliged for your assistance as ever...

My guess is that the motors pull a bit of ampere at full load. So any 12V?
How much Watt do the motors have x2 plus a bit of spare would be my approach.

30 Kg-cm @ 30 rpm is only ~9w of power, so in theory a 2A 12v power supply would be enough.

Now, there are inefficiencies in the real world, and it's possible I missed something, but these aren't massive motors.

We spec 5 amps to be on the safe side :-)

Oh wow, much lower than I expected. I forgot the gears :-)
