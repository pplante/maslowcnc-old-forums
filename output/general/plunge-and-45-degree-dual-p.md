looks cool but at $52 kind of pricy anyone know of a cheaper source? it would save you a bit change potentially.

probably not, that looks like a specialty bit. It will work only if you have either exactly the right thickness material, or if you are willing to cut deep enough into the material under your workpiece.

In a router table, where the bit can extend above the workpiece, it can be a little more useful, but it seems targeted at a pretty specific use-case.

It looks like it might be useful for a champfer pass after the part is cut but still held in place. Not sure about dealing with tabs, though.
