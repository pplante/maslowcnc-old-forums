I need to purchase the router, plywood, and 2x4s prior to April 15th to work with my school's budget.  I take it the recommended router is the Rigid R2200, but could I get specs on the needed wood?  Thank you!

When I looked at the sketchup model the other day I found that it was spec'd for roughly 3 2"x4"x10' (not the standard-nominal 2x4, that are actually 1.5"x3.5" you'd find in abundance at a big box hardware store). I suspect you could use the more standard sort (and I in fact plan to). You'll also need either 1 4'x8' sheet of 3/4" ply and lots of 3/4" scraps for various parts or just buy 2 sheets. You'll also need some way to fasten all that together I suspect. I intend to use some combination of screws I have kicking around but perhaps you'd want to add that to your shopping list as well. If the screws end up having too much play I'll probably glue it together as well though having the option of partial disassembly would be quite handy for eventual transport.

You can absolutely us the standard 2x4s. I should update the sketchup model to show the true dimensions of 1.5"x3.5". @mindeye is right that it's designed to use three 10' 2x4s and two sheets of 3/4 plywood. None of the material dimensions are critical so if it turns out that a different thickness (close to 3/4) of plywood is much cheaper that will work well too.



If you are trying to get everything done in one trip I would recommend getting a sheet of the cheapest 1/4 inch plywood to use as a waste board behind what you are cutting, but you don't need that.

I have been thinking about the waste board (disclaimer I don't have the machine yet, just poking around your site. I was wondering if it would be possible to create spacers between the work surface and the sheet to be cut. Sort of like mini pedastals placed strategically. 

Another thought would be to use sound deadening board as the waste board--its cheap and a little softer so bits may last longer?

I think that's a great idea. I've been using the sheet of insulation foam we bought for the materials testing update and it works well.

that makes sense. just be careful of the styrofoam

Looking forward to seeing your product available for purchase :-)

while you could use pedestals they are going to be a lot harder to setup than you expect, you not only have to support the uncut workpiece, but you need to support all the pieces after they are cut, and support them in a way that prevents them tilting.



a sheet of thin MDF is cheap and can last for quite a while if you are careful not to cut too deep. You can even make it a practice to leave just a hair of material around your parts and cut the last 1/64 or so with a knife or similar tool to free the parts and never touch the spoilboard unless you make a mistake

How does that airspace affect tearout?

the less support the edges have, the more tearout you will see, but you can also select different bits to minimize tearout. St right bits are more likely to cause tearout than spiral bits on the clean edge, but spiral bits are either up or down with one clean side and one side that will probably have a bit more tearout.



higher cutter speed, and a final finishing pass that removes less material than prior passes will help minimize the tearout as well. Worst case, sandwich your finished piece between two layers of something else (but they need to be tightly clamped, one trick is to glue them together with a layer of paper between the wood, when you finish you can split it at the joint and sand off the glue/paper remains)

i think introducing an airspace at the rear of the workpiece would cause you more grief than replacing your backboard every once in a while. You can start new projects where your backboard is least used and flip it over when it gets too used. As David said, you only have to go through your workpiece a tiny amount. If you really wanted, you could use a surface planing router bit of about 3" dia ($40) to reface your board occasionally. Dust from backboard can be hazardous esp MDF!

Amen to MDF dust hazard. 

I hadn't considered tearout--these are great insights. For us another issue will be warpage as we tend to use cheaper materials for set props than fine furniture makers might. I imagine a sheet of 1/4" ply could vary a bit from one area to another in terms of its distance from the work surface
