## The MaslowBH Base Stand
Posted on *2017-02-17 17:42:04* by *gero*

Why did I modify the Base Stand:
-Sketchup and I don't get along.
-Remodelling the base gave me the chance to address a few personal adjustments and to apply what I would call “Ease of construction”. (Sorry for the loss of the lovely “Bunny Ears”. Hopefully the MaslowBH will cut itself a new beautiful stand.)
-I love the workflow -> modelling with Blender -> having all sizes and dimensions and a 3D view and idea of what I am going to build.

Missing Parts:
-The motor mount plates are missing because I have not decided if I will stick with the original.
I have reserved an area giving me flexibility on where they will go. (Maybe cut out slots to experiment with different positions)
-The original has nice “Leg Support Stabilizers” plates that I will put on. I don’t have the time to put them in this Blender file.
-Sled missing

The Approach:
My preference was to stay as close as possible to the Mother.
On Ubuntu Mate, with help of Crossover, I got Setchup2016 working and could look at the Mother Maslow. I tilted the base as best I could to have a front view, plane to the ply wood sheet.
This sheet helped me with all other dimensions because I know the size.
I took another screenshot from the right side and was set to go.
In Bender I made the plywood sheet, set the screenshots for front and side, tilted and scaled them so they would match with the sheet.
In the model I have chosen what I think is called a 2x4 in US,  metric 38mm x  89mm for the “Wood Beams”.

Mods:
-The back of the legs are altered to a 90 degree angle. Why? My first idea was that I would carry a full size plywood sheet by my self and would “drop” it on the base. I wanted the chance to screw it to the wall if I have to. Later is realized that it would also ease the idea of creating an “Adjustable Tilt Angle” for finding the “Sweet Spot” of my setup. It also eases the implementation of a second Maslow on back.
- The reason why those lovely Bunny Ears are changed to squares is related to my availability of tools. No band saw, no disc or belt sander and cutting two sheets of plywood with my jigsaw has failed and will be not tried again.
-If I would ever decide to have different motor mount positions, the squares give me the space to play.

Thanks for posting this. I too am interested in the 'bunny ears' and the motor mounts. I hope @Bar gives us a quick look at these soon.
 I've been thinking of hinging it from the wall, to pull out at the bottom when in use and fold back when not.

Thanks for the "hinging it from the wall, to pull out at the bottom when in use". How could I have missed that...

---

Posted on *2017-02-17 19:05:45* by *gero*

I have forgotten to mention that almost all 2x4 are over sized. The reason is that the jointing is not finalized.

---

Posted on *2017-02-17 21:49:31* by *davidlang*

for some reason the links aren't working for me (no such page errors from the forum software)

As I understand it, the bunny ears are intended to be cut on the maslow with a process something like the following

temporarily mount the motors, and temporarily hook the chains ti the router.

go through some sort of calibration routine

hold the router to keep the chains tensioned as the motors pull it around to cut the rabbit ears, permanent motor mounts, chain mounts, sled, etc

As for the angle, mounting things vertically means that you now have to anchor the wood you are cutting instead of letting gravity do that for you

---

Posted on *2017-02-17 21:56:48* by *scottsm*

I understand the reason for the (19 degree?) angle, but thought I might reclaim some floorspace when not it's in use. Interesting idea about boot-strapping the final parts. Much fun to come, can't wait!

---

Posted on *2017-02-18 03:28:42* by *gero*

The MaslowBH base is only vertical in the design. From the Scetchup file I got a 15 degree tilt and I will follow that. Somewhere on this forum I read about tested tilt angles, but I can't find it any more.

Waste of time. I don't -build- temporary. The motor mount arms should be plain old chunks of 2x4. Then for decorative purposes add a -facade- of rabbit ears or naked dancing zombies or whatever lights your fire. The facade material can be foam board, light, cheap, white background takes color from any airbrush, rattle can, or Sharpie. Heck, give the blank facade to the kids and let them decorate it. :) The facade can easily be changed later on any whim.

No question that good, firm attachments for the motors will be important. I'm waiting to see, hoping I can make them accommodate materials of various thicknesses. I can provide a level surface for the sled, but I imagine the plane of chain path wants to be parallel to the surface being machined.

> @jbarchuk

I would be suspicious that a 2x4 would be rigid enough to counter the forces in play there... the "ears" are two layers of 3/4" material; the same thickness as a 2x4 but much wider.

---

Posted on *2017-02-19 08:58:49* by *davidlang*

part of the design criteria is to not assume that you have a full woodshop available to you. /The rabbit ears, the chain mounts (to keep the extra chain from tangling up on the ground), the sled, and probably other parts would be a realpain to make manually, but rather easy to have the CNC make.

We don't yet know what the temporary mounts are going to be, they could be to just mount the motors in the corners of a piece of plywood.

---

> @scottsm
> I imagine the plane of chain path wants to be parallel to the surface being machined.
I've thought about that too because for sure, or the geometry gets whacked when the material thickness varies.
To account for that variation I think an adjustable mount can be added at one of two places. This first one I think is better than the second. Here's a pic of the sled end of the chain.
 [Maslowcnc-01-sled-chain-attach-01](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:uUPr:maslowcnc01sledchainattach01.png.jpg) 
That bracket that the chain mounts to has plenty of extra length to easily be variable. That's the easiest way to do this because don't need a ladder to reach up to the motor mount. (Yeah, keep that in mind -- after the machine is built any work done at the motor end of the deal needs a ladder. Or tip it over an lay it flat, which kills the 'compact space saving' side of the equation.)
Or, at the motor mount end of the chain, this pic:
 [Maslowcnc-motor-gear-chain-closeup-01](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:uSej:maslowcncmotorgearchaincloseup01.png.jpg) 
The 'master' plate in the pic that the motor mounts on can remain fixed. Imagine removing the motor , add another 'slave' plate that -slide- forward and backward, fastened to the lower plate with bolts that go through -slots-. Then the motor is mounted on that slave plate.
Either way, it's not very easy to adjust because when the machine is assembled all the weight of the sled is on the chains and motors. Can't just pop out a chain mount at will without proper -support- for that weight.
There's a fix for that too....
Imagine the sled at the bottom-center of travel. (Or for the older folks like me mid-center to not need to bend over and strain the back to work on it. :) ) Run a bolt through the main base sheet of plywood at the top-center directly above the sled. Run a light chain from that bolt, down to the sled and around the router, and back up. (Or add another bolt or some kind of attachment point to the sled.)
Lift the sled a little to take the weight off the drive chains, connect the temporary support chain, and put the weight of the sled on that chain.
Now the drive chains can be detached from the sled and moved to another mount point. Heck even both chains can be detached for adjustment or other maintenance purposes such as changing the chain or working on the motor end of the chain.

Thanks for posting the pictures - I've been wishing I could see the motor mounted in place. Your point about a ladder is good.

---

Posted on *2017-02-20 04:57:26* by *davidlang*

roller chain has a fair bit of side to side flexibility (think about how bike chains flex as you change gears), and even at the top corners there is a good two feet of chain (18 inches vertically and almost a foot horizontally). not being parallel will add some error, but _very_ little. a 1" difference in the chain at 24" results in ~3/128" of error. reduce it to a half inch and the error drops to ~1/256"

if the chains only have 1' exposed at the corners, being 1"off is an error of 1/32" and being 1/2" off is an error of 1/128"

once you are 3' away from the motors, being 1" off is an error of 3/256 and being 1/2" off is an error of <1/256"

realistically, we are probably going to be working on material between 1/4 and 1" almost all the time (with 1/2" and 3/4" being most common), so if you position the motor mounts for 3/4" thick material, the amount of error that you will have is very small.

I'll bet that any variable height motor mount will end up shifting the motors around enough to cause more error than a 1/2" offset, probably more than a 1"offset

---

Posted on *2017-02-20 09:22:25* by *jbarchuk*

You're right about the minimal error. The router base I'm trying to use has only 1" travel and I'm sure most bases are about the same. The error will also be worse only in the top corners. I'm trying to take into account all the possible worst cases. And make allowance for the ONE knucklehead (read: Excessively Imaginative Beautiful Mind :) ) who will take it to super-extreme, mount the router on a lead screw drive, and want to route through the full thickness of a 6" slab to make a glass top coffee table. (For that I actually thought of mounting the motors on slide rails to fully cancel the error but decided to not mention it.)

Inspired by the momentum I want best of all worlds now. Scottsm's idea hinging it from the wall. Can be taken off the wall an will stand. Tilt angle adjustable to find the sweet spot (different routers, weights). Enough space to playing with different motor mount passions (.py). I am lucky to have a girlfriend that understands.

---

Posted on *2017-02-23 16:34:48* by *gero*

Because of budget this will have to solve the experimental tilte angle for the moment http://www.duden.de/_media_/full/W/Wagenheber-201020518505.jpg

I'm glad that other pic you showed was a real screw jack. The frame alone, no router/sled/motors/chains/power supply will weigh I think a bit over 100#. Add those other parts, a waste sheet, and the material to be worked on and it approaches 200#.
It's also unwieldly, 7' tall, 10' wide and only 22" deep. It's not the kind of thing you can toss around at will. To mount it on a wall, that takes some structural planning.

It is done.
Despite mother nature's attempt to bring this island under sea level, 3 times in a row, my car giving up on me because it refused to be a boat. MaslowBH is alive and back on track.
Nothing to be proud off, and not recommended for copy. More a: DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! It turned out as Frankensteins Monster of a Maslow. I hope I can find some time soon to post all the failures on this approach. It is hanging on the wall and supports it's weight plus mine. (tested). The car jack works well and can even be turned by hand. [Base](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:U5JJ:base.jpg.jpg)  [Jack](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:4EG8:jack.jpg.jpg)

How about a few highlights? What were the worst setbacks, what to -most- avoid?

Very nice 👍 - the jack is a masterly touch.

@jbarchuk As requested here are the highlights of failures building the hinged MaslowBH base:

Lessons learned:
- Pay more attention to comments on your approach in the forum. Just reading over them without taking the time to digest, will make you miss some valuable information.
- Murphy's law is true. Once you stepped in the (censored), it will stick to your shoe and follow you around.
- Putting yourself under pressure is contra productive, with the result of wasting time and energy.
- Planing the work-flow of mounting can prevent errors and save time.
- The universe is always in balance. Jing and Jang. There is a counter law to Murphy. At the end, all is good.

The key failures:
- The biggest joke was that I had built the frame flat on the floor, face up, with the ears away from the wall it would be mounted on. Once the parts where together and I looked at the room, I realized that the width of the room was shorter than the length and there was no way I could turn this monster around. So directly after assembly 1 came disassembly 1.
- For some stupid reason, I had my m ind set that it would be easier to have the complete frame mounted, before attaching it to the wall. This turned out to be the worst approach for alignment of 5 holes through 2 beams and in the wall. Max 2 out of 5 screws could be aligned with the anchors. After a few hours of helpless attempts to get it mounted anyway, assembly 2 was followed by disassembly 2.
- The hinges needed to be fixed before hanging anything on the wall, because there was no space to the ceiling to do that later. The attempt to mount the wall beam and the frame beam without the rest of the frame worked out. Here I discovered that my workaround with holes in the frame beam, to get my wrench through, was totally unnecessary. Without the rest of the frame attached, I could just flip the front beam upwards with the hinges, to tighten the screws under it :-) . [Wrench](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:FFGs:wrench.jpg.jpg) 
Failures that turned out to be good: 
- In the 3D plan I had missed a gap of 1 sheet thickness between base sheet and frame. Because the frame was mounted flat on the floor and the ears are 2 sheets thick, I was missing 18mm on the back of the base sheet. I will just glue a few pieces of scrap ply to the frame to give an even support.
The good thing about this mistake is, that I can skip the base sheet now. I can cut on 1 sheet directly without having to worry that I cut into my frame. A reduced weight of 1 sheet is another advantage. 
- Having the 4 ears cut by my dear fellows from Gandhi Land was a bad idea. Their level of acceptable tolerance is far off from mine. I did not check the angles, so my attempted 90 degree cutouts are not near a right angle. The advantage is that I need to squeeze the sheet in and it is clamped by this mistake. [Frame](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:E7ei:frame.jpg.jpg) 
I hope this post could provide some smiles or even laughter and can help others not to do such silly mistakes. Regards from the tiny Kingdom of Bahrain, Gero. [MaslowBH-Hinged](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:brV2:maslowbhhinged.jpg.jpg)

Posted on *2017-03-23 12:05:27* by *gero*

P.S. If the MaslowBH would ever cut itself some legs, they would probably look something like this quick and dirty sketch.  [Legs](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:9VBL:legs.jpg.jpg) With less holes, for more structural strength. And I would need a couple of those. The flat-pack, to-go version needs a little more thoughts.

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 16:04:48* by *scottsm*

I, too, assembled without thinking about the final orientation :) had to move much stuff to get it rotated, and it's an unwieldy beast to wrestle by one's self.
I like the idea of 'flat pack' legs, the ones you drew look like to me they would be strong enough.

Wow. Between you and Gero, who would have thought there'd be so much pure entertainment building a CNC!!? Got vid? I'd have paid money to see the double feature.
On the plus side, others are reading these stories and will LEARN from your misfortunes.
You DON'T wanna hear about the hour it took me yesterday to draw six straight parallel lines. Things went a lot faster when I finally decide to quit screwing around with all that MEASURING foolishness, and just draw the stupid lines. (No disrespect intended for the parallel lines in the audience, it really was my fault.)

---

Posted on *2017-04-07 07:05:20* by *gero*

Not sure Who is following this :-) . It is specific to my frame so I'll just ask here. I'm about to mount the Motors and would love to have the now most widely used distance on final frames between A) Center of motor axis. B) Height of top of the sheet to be cut to horizontal line motor axis. Just for comparability aspects. Can I assume that the defaults in Ground Control are those figures?

---

Posted on *2017-04-07 08:36:59* by *blsteinhauer88*

Mine is working great so far, few distortions at the far corners and top.  I have 18 inches from workspace to motor, and my motors are 116.5 inches apart.

---

Posted on *2017-04-07 08:37:43* by *blsteinhauer88*

The defaults are close, likely from Bar's machine

---

Posted on *2017-04-07 08:43:32* by *scottsm*

My experience is that more distance is better. The defaults are good, less is a compromise.

Posted on *2017-04-07 10:45:37* by *davidlang*

as far as motor positions go, you are trying to trade off total machine size for accuracy/reliabilty

as the sled moves to the top center, the tension on the chains gets high and accuracy suffers a bit (with the maslow 8k steps/rev the accuracy of the motors is insanely high so the accuracy part doesn't matter here, just the tension

As the sled moves to the extreme sides (as one of the chains nears vertical), the tension of the other chain gets low, which causes the sled to 'stick' instead of slide. This hurts accuracy, but a slicker sled or angle  (and possibly more weight) can help the accuracy here.

to increase the 'sweet spot' move the motors further apart and work lower from the motors (i.e. mount them higher) The stock design is bar's compromise of machine size to get reasonable accuracy across the 4'x8' sheet with his first machine.

---

Posted on *2017-04-07 12:06:13* by *gero*

Further apart and mount them higher is what I read now. Plus I have a starting point. The oversizes squares and how I made the motor mount s will give me variation of positions to test. For the start I want to be as close to the Mother as possible. Would not know how to adjust what before I have seen it (Her,Him) moving around. Am thinking of painting the sheet white and with colored felt pens drawing a grid of hor and ver lines in 10cm distance. Once the hardware is set up and running I know I have to face the CAD/.gcode.

---

Posted on *2017-04-07 12:22:27* by *scottsm*

To face the CAD, take a look at Easel. It lets you create boxes or circles or just plain lines, and will generate gcode from them. It will take SVG files too.  Also will generate gcode from tracing an image (haven't tried that yet).

No software movements today. :-( Part of the weekend stolen by work and the other part from me insisting to have different motor mounts. Shame on me for this design, but live is beating me up this year and a trip to the hardware store is out of question. So the scrap lying around had to do for the moment. A rusty TV-Mount was found and used.

My jigsaw not cutting straight through 2 sheets made it so tight. I adjust buy ~0.5 mm by hammering in or out.  [U-cut](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:EDZ9:ucut.jpg.jpg) The frame almost vertical, chains on the sled in the 4th hole from down gave me 94mm from bottom of sled. The same was adjusted to motor mounts from surface to sprocket.  [MSLW-Bh-S](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:Cw6G:mslwbhs.jpg.jpg) The rubber stole some time because I counted the chain links in this picture. https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/8596731476320712737.jpg That was far to high, tried 150mm lower, still to tight and after more 300mm I was convinced tha t the sled could reach the outer-down corners without taring the rubber apart.  [Rub-hk](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:25X1:rubhk.jpg.jpg) It's hanging.  [MSLW-Bh-F](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:z4hD:mslwbhf.jpg.jpg) Fair enough for today. To be continued.

The path to the 15 squares of happiness

Preamble:
For those who can’t be bothered to read through the development of this wonderful project and think, WTF, it is 3mm off in the upper corners, I have a suggestion. Build this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_W0cPu5Gqs
Hopefully it will keep you busy and out of here.

For the others, the Amazing Founders, the Dedicated People that daily improve and fix the Firm- / Software (https://github.com/MaslowCNC), the Incredible Team of Beta-Testers and the fantastic Newcomers that contribute with their questions and soon will add more with their findings, THANK YOU!
You can not imagine how happy this test pattern made me.

Body:
The most important and difficult question raised by @MakerMark was, how many bottles of wine it took to create the .nc file and cut it. Not that easy to answer, because not all of the wine went into the process and some beers, but not all, went into it as well. But the total of wine is easy. 2 bottles [Wine](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:HnPP:wine.jpg.jpg) , each 2 Liter = 4 Liter, in US, 1.05669 gallon.
From here [Start](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:1D8P:start.jpg.jpg) to here [E nd](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:S5MO:end.jpg.jpg) in 3 days, makes something like a 1/3 of a gallon per day.
SAFETY FIRST! (https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/Safety-First) Do not operate cutting tools while intoxicated!

Now that I have somehow covered that question, we can move on to the less important things.
Why did I alter the original test file https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/tree/master/Testing%20and%20Calibration
Being a metric guy since birth, only having a metal ruler with both, mm and Inch and a caliper that does not reach 152.4mm (6 Inch), I was forced. I wrote a 100mm x 100mm gcode for a 6 mm cutting bit and close to the centre, I was within a 10th of a mm. [Perfect](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:b6WG:perfect.jpg.jpg) 
That was a great motivation.
Why and how did I make the gcode with a spread sheet:
The why is, because makercam (http://www.makercam.com) gave me some ‘cryptic’ positioning with 17 digits behind the decimal point of a mm, that I did not like to measure how accurate the Maslow is.
How was not that difficult, since allot of the X and Y positions are on straight X Y lines, most was copy and paste and add or remove a ‘-’. The spreadsheet is here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/1sedgnbeljxlyry/pattern.xlsx?dl=0).
Exporting to .csv, removing the separations like ‘,’ or ‘ ” ’ and renaming it to . nc, I ended up with gcode that the Maslow can run. (Issue?) I did not see my pattern in GC, perhaps because my gcode has no ‘blanks’. It did cut it, so who cares :-). The gcode is here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/5rgxlz6r69h3j5v/testpattern.nc?dl=0).
An other thing I altered was going deeper 3 times. The repeatability of the the Maslow is proven, so I went with one cut, to speed up the time it takes. (~45 minutes for my test pattern of 15 squares) I took out the circle as well to speed up further, because for me it was proven that if there is a diversion, it effects both, the square and the circle.

Believe it or not. I am dealing with NOT ENOUGH FRICTION.
If someone could recommend a tape to add friction… lol, just kidding.
I have a car jack on the mount and within less then a minute I have more angle = more friction.
Deliberately choosing a to low frame angle of 6 degree, a ‘plex sheet’ that has a far to clean surface and a sled made out of some hybrid between paper and cardboard  [Sled](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:hLkC:sled.jpg.jpg) , don’t know the name, that seems to be waxed already, I have a sled that is wiggling.
This is noticeable clearly because my gcode goes directly from X to Y moves, resulting in corners that show the cutter to go a little wide on the turns [Top-middle](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:XpsX:topmiddle.jpg.jpg).  The other side of my test sheet I had painted, because I thought I will draw first, before cutting. I could not find a pen that is short enough, so that idea was dumped. Since I turned the sheet around, there is clear evidence that I need to increase my angle (and / or) friction. At least on this sheet.
The top and bottom on the right side have a curve on the right down edge, that I have seen before in an other post. [Highest-right](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:JX3q:highestright.jpg.jpg)  [Lowest-right](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:xwzD:lowestright.jpg.jpg) 
The top right has that curve also on the top left corner. The top middle square has the most noticeable ‘wiggles’ / ‘waves’.
Square 10 has a Z-Axis glitch [Z-gltch](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:pe1W:zgltch.jpg.jpg) where the sled was moving to the centre while Z was still moving up. Tried to find the glitch in the code, but failed. To intoxicated maybe.

Conclusion:
This is a damn hell of a machine that I am proud to own.
I see the results of this test as an incredible achievement, for a project ‘under development’.
The world wide community, giving a s&#! about borders, race, skin colour, nationality, patriotism and religion, might be capable of giving me back some hope on humanity. It somehow proves that the earth is round, we all sit on that same ball and have nowhere else to go.
I have personally gained strength, through the glories People involved.
Maslow is not just another tool in my workshop. It is far more. I can’t thank you all enough for this.
In my dreams, I visualize Maslowians from all over the world, folding their falt-pack Maslow bases and travelling to countries with earthquakes, zunamies, hurricanes, while cargo companies ship containers of plywood. To ease the trauma of the kids, give them a roof over their head, a chair, a table and bed. Get them back to school. Dreams, yes. I am sure the Maslow was one too, a while ago.

to make sure I understand you, you are saying you need more friction because the sled swings when it hits the corners and changes direction. Is this correct?

If so, a slower feed rate when cutting will help temporarily (as would a lighter sled), but the right answer is that the acceleration limit needs to be changed. I don't see a way to set the acceleration in g-code, I think that needs to be set in the firmware (and it may need to wait for the control loop improvements that @bar is planning on making).

>  It somehow proves that the earth is round, we all sit on that same ball and have nowhere else to go.

Well, I would like to see us change those last two items :-)

I'd rather not decrease the speed, I want to go faster :-). With the mm issue, I had incredible precession going very slow, i think, but I need to slow down again to prove that. At F500 I am tempted to increase the angle and run the test again. New sheets of plywood are arriving soon, so I get rid of those 'plex' things. That will add friction too. So many variables

---

Posted on *2017-04-27 12:08:21* by *davidlang*

a note on the gcode, you do a lot of
g1z3f300 type things, the feedrate (f300) is something you can set and it will stay the same until the next time you set it. So I like to do things like

g1z-3F300
g1z3

you also have a different feedrate for g0 than for g1 (this is the only difference between them), the idea being that you can move much faster when you aren't cutting.

a feedrate of 500mm is close to 20in, and @bar has set the max feedrate to 25in for now, until he gets the new feedback control loops in place (at which point the limit should move back up to 48in (~1200mm)

There should be some way to set the drilling mode to a particular speed so that we don't have to keep switching feed rates (in any case, pulling out of the wood should be able to go at max speed). minor tweaks like that will help speed the process (in part by shortening the g-code so that the arduino can parse it faster)

---

Posted on *2017-04-27 12:09:54* by *davidlang*

I don't see where you failed to retract the bit either.

you should be able to use g0 for retracting the bit

---

Posted on *2017-04-27 12:10:34* by *Bar*

Thank you for the kind words gero. You get the dream.

Acceleration ramping is a big priority, as I'm working on the feed back control re-write it's going to be much easier. I'm on it!

---

Posted on *2017-04-27 12:21:24* by *davidlang*

I think that we may be very near the point where there is more value in you taking time from direct support of beta testers to implement the feed back control re-write than in continuing the wack-a-mole debugging process. There seem to be a lot of improvements that are waiting for that, and I suspect that as you do that re-write you will find/fix other bugs in the process.

Posted on *2017-04-27 12:22:50* by *scottsm*

Does G0 retract the bit before moving? I try to get the bit up before traversing because I've had z cuts like gero.

---

Posted on *2017-04-27 12:37:03* by *Bar*

Great question! G0 retracts the bit at the same time as it's doing the XY move. Technically G0 should just run all the motors as fast as possible until they end up where they are supposed to (if you follow the spec). I had it coordinate the XY move because I think it's much nicer, but z doesn't happen first. 

If you want to make sure the Z happens before the XY I would put them on different lines like 
G0 X.25
G0 X10 Y10

If that isn't retracting before moving, it's a bug and we should track it down!

---

Posted on *2017-04-27 12:52:12* by *davidlang*

per the gcode specs, if you give all coordinates on one line g0x0y0z0 it should do a smooth move between where you are and where it's telling you to go (in all three dimensions)

so you should do a 2-line move as Bar says to retract and then move.

Remember that the machine doesn't know where the wood starts, we tend to assume it starts at Z=0, but that's just for our convienience, the machine doesn't actually care.

MaslowBH is out of service :-( and looks like for a while.

The plans for today where,
1) trace a buffer overflow issue I had Thursday night, to get some details
2) confirm that mm files have adjustable feedrates and close the github issue
3) cut @davidlang's test file

1) might have fried my motor controller, so testing 2 and 3 not possible at the moment.

It started with a short notice birthday beach party invite and the idea to carve out 'Happy Birthday'. The .svg was created and put into makercam resulting in this (do not blame me if it causes damage) https://www.dropbox.com/s/ezvishzbdjfhxl5/reem.nc?dl=0 .nc file. It looked good in GroundControl but ended with a 'buffer overflow' and 'USB connection lost' after the first letter. Since the cutter went mad, I had to do an emergency shutdown to prevent damage, so could not get much details. This morning the plan was to replicate that, with the cutter up and router off, to be able to give more feedback. The issue was first replicated with a 3 days old firmware and GC, then again with both downloaded today.
The buffer ov erflow is one thing, perhaps related to the ridiculous amounts of digits makercam puts in metric files. I someone would just ask me to add those number, I would tilt too.
The BIG issue and possible danger is how GC reacts after! It assumes it's center completely off, 'sled down' moves the sled UP in real life, while on the screen it moves down. Quite up on the sheet that did not look good. This is what might have killed the controller? To much amps flowing? The right motor died first, shortly after the Z-Axis (although not involved and running free, so no load). Wiping Eprom, trying older firmware and GC and the newest. Testing motors always fail with right and Z-Axis. Taking all apart and back together also did not help. The  	test_electonics_firmware.ino also only turns the left motor.
The serial monitor in Arduino IDE shows:

[Chip](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:eqbE:chip.jpg.jpg) Measuring the diodes I found one that let through in both directions. Unslodering, lifting one side up I found it to be fine. Checking the chip the is a pass in both directions, that is not there on the other chip. That seems to confirm that the chip itself is fried. :-(

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 10:13:53* by *davidlang*

leaving the diode off should still let the board work, it removes a 'just in case' protection from the board (ideally solder a replacement on though :-)

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 10:27:41* by *scottsm*

If you could live without the z-axis motor for a while, we could get you a version of firmware that uses that connector for your right motor?

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 10:31:50* by *gero*

Thank you for the suggestion. Both motors would run on the right chip. I read that has some strange behavior. Plus will that chip take the load of 2 motors?

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 10:53:56* by *Bar*

First, I'm sorry to hear that we're sending you a new board express, and I will look into the buffer overflow issue with that file. Let me see if I can cook up something for us to test with.

The second chip probably won't be happy with running both motors, but if it can hang on until your new board arrives I think it's worth a try. 

The L298P (the motor controller chip) is supposed to have over current and over voltage protection, so we shouldn't be able to blow them up. I'll look into that side of things also.

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 11:07:53* by *Bar*

Is it OK if I send the new board via DHL? That way you will get it in a few days rather than a week.

Perfect, I'll go to the DHL office right now!

I agree that we need a spare parts store. I'm not quite sure how to do it because I want to honor everyone on the waiting list in order, so I want to find a way to discourage people from just buying the whole machine as parts :-). Any thoughts on how we can do that?

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 11:28:32* by *gero*

On the PCB, perhaps a overload-diode, or more easy to change a fuse?

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 11:32:31* by *gero*

For the shop, spare parts for people who bought the Kit only. I understand that getting more kits out is highest priority and it will benefit us all.

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 11:36:32* by *gero*

Or just on case to case bases per email. I would really like to have a board spare and have no issues with paying the PCB and the shipment. Just can't imagine if I start my first project and then I get stuck because of a chip.

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 11:43:34* by *Bar*

Good point, I will send you two so that you have a spare, no need to pay for it. My apologies for the delay while you are waiting for it to arrive.

I'd say priority #1 is getting all of you guys building things. My goal in starting this project was to show that this idea could work, and that we can make CNC accessible to more people and I think the best way to do that is to get you guys building as much cool stuff as possible. I do also think it's important to get kits out to everyone who has been waiting all these months, but you guys are priority #1

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 11:47:12* by *Bar*

Rather than add a fuse, I'd rather spec a chip that we can't possibly damage. I chose the L298P because it's a chip that has been around for a long time and is widely used, but it might be time to spec a new chip. The Texas Instruments DRV series of chips looks like it might be a good option.

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 12:20:04* by *Bar*

The [L6206](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/6e/e7/d6/58/65/53/48/2a/CD00002346.pdf/files/CD00002346.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00002346.pdf) looks like it might be a better option. It's similar in operation to the L298P, but a little more modern. I mostly put this here for my own benefit later.

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 13:16:15* by *gero*

That is very kind of you Bar, did not mean it that way. I am checking to order 2 of those H-Bridges, although my soldering skills on SMD are a shaky, I am determined to repair the controller. Unless you want me to send it for debugging. As far I can tell the short is between GND and OUT 1, explaining that right motor is not moving. The rest seems fine, but Z-Axis is not working either, although they seem separated in the diagram.

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 13:45:28* by *Bar*

It's been my experience that once chips fail they do strange things. Sometimes they'll still partly work but in strange ways. Replacing the chip is a great idea. If you are going to order those, [here](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/L298P/497-1396-5-ND/585919) is a link to where we got them. I've got two new arduino shields tested and I'm heading to the DHL store now :-)

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 14:19:56* by *Bar*

Unfortunately DHL is closed for the weekend, but my guess is that DHL sent Monday morning will get there faster than another service sent today. What do you think?

Posted on *2017-04-29 14:21:33* by *gero*

Yes, DHL should be fastest. Great thanks!

---

Posted on *2017-04-29 14:24:55* by *gero*

Gives me some time to do a few adjustments on the frame and the sled. I would have kept those unsolved forever, because it is more fun to cut :-)

The standing version of the chip is for an Arduino proto shield I happen to have lying around. I am happy to read that we can go with a lot less weight. I am ready to reduce weight and go for a steeper angle, as I need more preassure on the sled, but I'm still curious if is was a 17kg sled at a 6 degree angled frame, at the top of the sheet, that fried the chip. The protoshield with measure points will hopefully cure my curiosity and I will not kill my 'production motor shield'.

---

Posted on *2017-04-30 03:22:11* by *davidlang*

no matter what the angle and weight, running the motors at full power is what would cause the problem (if it was caused by the load as opposed to manufacturing problems, you aren't the first person to have a failed board)

---

Posted on *2017-04-30 03:22:59* by *davidlang*

can you put a heatsink on the chips? or arrange for a fan to blow on them? anything you can do to cool them will let them live longer.

---

Posted on *2017-04-30 04:42:34* by *gero*

I had the heatsinks on the Maslow motor shield and have not put it in a box yet. The AC needs to run all time in the Maslow-room when testing, as in spring the temperatures already go above 35C/95F. I had the Arduino on the top of the frame, but will place it down behind the frame now. There it will benefit more from the AC. The little fans, like for the R-Pi, would be an option, but I have a feeling that there will be a redesign of the shields soon ;-)

---

Posted on *2017-04-30 06:25:59* by *MakerMark*

@gero Sorry to hear about the chip getting fried. I agree with David that the weight of your sled shouldn't have caused the issue but I'd be curious to see the pid values from the motor calibration process on a heavier sled like yours to help document a base of values. Thanks!

Posted on *2017-04-30 11:12:51* by *davidlang*

I think they have already received the shields for the first order, so they are probably not going to throw them away and order new ones unless there are bigger problems that we've seen so far.
