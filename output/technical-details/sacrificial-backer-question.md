## Sacrificial backer question/suggestion
Posted on **2016-11-01 09:02:30** by **bobbysteinmetz**:

Due to material variation and user error there will always be some damage to the surface beneath the workpiece when doing through-cuts. To avoid replacing the main structure of the machine, is it possible to put a sacrificial backer behind the workpiece? Say 1/4" OSB, or foamboard?

I guess worst case you'd just have to shim out the motors to keep the chains inline?

Yes. I leave a piece of 1/4 inch MDF back there all the time. You can use any material you want, but I like MDF because it cuts very cleanly

A few minutes of extra preparation may prove useful. I was assuming my first test would be with the substrate bonded to a 4x8 sheet of cardboard, with a spray adhesive (like 3M Super 77) or something. This might also alleviate the issue of pieces "falling" when cut through, if you don't cut completely through the cardboard.

There are some 'old school' DIY CNC machines that uses a 3/4 ply as a base, and you put a 3/4 MDF as sacrificial plate.  Once it gets 'too rough' they use the CNC to 'surface' the MDF for a new sacrificial surface.  After it gets close to the Ply, they surface it again, and just glue a new 3/4 MDF surface to the old MDF surface (only to give it a good smooth supported base) and run and play more.  The MDF never gets fully removed from the Plywood in their scenario.

There are special 'surfacing' bits, but I think any strait router bit or a 'bowl' bit should work.  Smaller bits just make it take longer.  Some surfacing bits can be 2+" in diameter (and pricey), bowl bits are cheaper and leave rounded edges and flat surface on bottom is not as big as the diameter of the bit.

I picked this up reading the MechMate.com forums.

That method makes sense in the context of a suspended-spindle router; I'm not sure how that would work with Maslow. Since the router base is in contact with the material at all times, I'm wondering if a worn/ruined backer could be re-surfaced that way?

My GUESS is if the backer is lightly scarred over much of the surface, then a 'light resurfacing' would work.  If there are large areas that are cut away, this method would not work on the Maslow.  But don't take my word for it, it needs to be evaluated more by someone that knows better than I do.  Replacing thin sheets of MDF or hardboard might be a better alternative rather than resurfacing to provide a new ware surface.

What do guys think about using a Foam Board as the sacrificial layer on top of plywood. Its cheap like $5 for 4x8 sheet. May make a bit of a mess though.

Or Maybe just use 1"x1" small wood squares 1 foot apart in a mesh pattern. These can be individually changed when damaged.

A pegboard, where you can add/remove pegs. Sorry for rambling on
