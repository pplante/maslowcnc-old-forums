You all rock! This project is something I'm really really really stoked about, and it's awesome to get to make it into a real thing thanks to you all. 



I want to say a special thank you to everyone in the forums. Knowing that there are real people on the other end is the reason we do this. At the end of the day the project is really about community and sharing. We're an open project because we want you to be involved, and so to everyone in the forums thank you for your questions, thank you for your comments, thank you for your support, and thank you for being involved!

You are welcome, and you deserve all of it, and more.  This is huge you guys!  You could have kept on traveling and been happy with just your own machine.  I'm so thankful that you have given all of us this opportunity.  I'm truly so excited to be a part of this!

Absolutely. You're bringing something to the market that was previously out of the realm of possibility for many of us. Even a small CNC (too small, really) is too costly for what it offers in my situation; Maslow fits a need for sure!
