## Anyone in the Bay Area?

If any of you are in the Bay Area or inclined to travel that way, it would be fun to maybe get together for a beer and a chat about the building process.  Hey, and if you don't drink beer, thatâ€™s no problem.  I'll have yours also!

I'm only going to be in the Bay Area until Maker Faire.  After that we're probably moving on to points east.  As such, this is a limited time offer!
