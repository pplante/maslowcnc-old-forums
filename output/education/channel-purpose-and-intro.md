## Channel purpose and intro
Posted on **2016-12-13 15:04:41** by **hannahteagle**:

Hey everyone!

This channel is mainly a space for winners of the free Maslow CNC contest to communicate and collaborate about potential projects, as it seems many of you have similar intended uses for the machine. Feel free to introduce yourselves and get conversations going however you please. As you can see, this forum channel is public, so any and all people are welcome to contribute, but this channel should serve mainly as a discussion space for those planning to use the machine in educational institution settings.

Thanks everyone for participating! So looking forward to seeing what you all come up with :)

hannah
