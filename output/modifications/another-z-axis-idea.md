## Another Z axis idea
Posted on *2017-06-06 17:53:09* by *gordonthiesfeld*

Hi all,

I had an idea based on this [mini router lift](https://www.inventables.com/projects/mini-router-lift].   After pricing this out, I noticed that the wheel kits and all of the nuts and bolts do start to add up.  

The [TrueUp Glide](http://www.openbuilds.com/builds/trueup-kit-version.4779/) replaces the wheels and bearings on the z axis with [5/16" nylon rod](http://3dwrx.com/pics/kit/insert.jpg).   So, I was thinking if you could take the mini router lift design with a piece of 20x40 or 20 x 60 v-slot, or even c-beam,  and replace the bearings with 5/16 nylon or delrin rod, I think the cost (not counting motors and electronics) would be about $20 dollars. 

Any thoughts?

why not use a threaded rod i.e. https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/T8-Lead-screw-200-mm-8mm-stainless-steel-Screw-Nut-Mounted-Ball-Bearing-Bracket-Shaft-Coupling/2665155_32774100534.html?spm=2114.12010612.0.0.rRag7J

any router lift can work, but none will require fewer parts and less costs (or be than hooking up to the height adjustment screw built into a router like the R2200

I agree, @davidlang, but I already own a few routers. One of them is a 2 1/4 hp Makita with no base that I got on craigslist for $40.  I'm just hoping to put it to use as inexpensively as possible.

Take a look at the z axis I am working on. I have the design almost done.
