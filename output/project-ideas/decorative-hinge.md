## Decorative hinge
Posted on **2017-02-20 05:49:43** by **jamesbil**:

I'm thinking of using Maslow to do a set of decorative false hinges for my workshop doors. 1/4" birch ply painted black.

Something like this..

That is just a stock pic from a quick search, but you get the idea.

Clever idea and would look great. Watch out for the thickness though, as compared to the total x/y size. If that's meant to be about 12x12 and you take out 1/8" relief from 1/4" that leaves only 1/8" for the material to support itself till it's mounted. That's very thin, flimsy, delicate, and not easy to 'survive' much handling. Doable but shaky. Starting with 3/8 would allow cutting 1/8" deeper relief and would probably survive an accidental drop test from 3'. Either way, looking forward to seeing the results.

The recommended G-Code creation software (MakerCAM.com) allows for tabs to be placed every "x" inches that aid in keeping delicate things like this in-place.



There's a video around here somewhere of Bar using this feature but I can't find it at the moment...

I was just planning on doing flat profile, no relief carving.

I would expect that to work great. You will probably want to do some tabs, but other than that I would expect it to go well. 



Can wait to see pictures.

For sure it needs that during cutting. The fragile thing, I meant after the tabs are cut and the carved wood is completely free/loose from the base material.

@jamesbil, that'll still be a very cool door decoration. The rivets could be simulated with clothing buttons. Or, leave it all flat and the relief could be airbrushed.

Ah. Yes. If I were making this at home, I would leave the tabs in all the way up to assembly and cut them out with a utility knife after gluing.
