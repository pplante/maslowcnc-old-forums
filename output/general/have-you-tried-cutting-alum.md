## have you tried cutting aluminum sheet metal?

I have used a $3 single flute 1/8" diameter downcut router bit from Aliexpress.com to cut aluminum sheet metal up to 1/16 thick.  1/16th takes a bit of force to cut through so I"m not sure if this machine can handle it? But I"m guessing 0.040" or thinner might be possible? Also Aluminum Composite Material with plastic core would probably work too.

FWIW, he's moving much faster (in that video) than 48"/min. I don't think that kind of cutting would be an issue at all.

Good video, I don't see many reasons why the Maslow can't cut Al as well as wood? Do you?

I've cut aluminum composite board with an 1/8" two flute carbide endmill in a little CNC router with a 200W spindle.  Pretty slick, made some working gears to try it out.
