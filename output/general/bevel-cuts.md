## Bevel cuts
Posted on **2016-11-30 20:01:22** by **karlthorp**:

Is Maslow capable of making bevel cuts with an end mill? I know I can use a bevel cutter but I don't want to have to deal with constant tool changes.

no, the Maskow always has the shaft of the cutter perpendicular to the workpiece

Horizontal 3-axis CNC's can make bevel cuts by varying the Z axis as it moves in X and/or Y along a beveled edge. (as opposed to a 5-axis machine that might tilt the workpiece or cutting tool.)

Bar has described Maslow (with the Z-axis) as a 2.5-axis machine, implying that the Z-axis is limited to simply varying depth of cut between passes.

Having recently futzed around with the Ryobi and Ridgid routers that share the depth adjustment mechanism Bar is working with, I would have to agree that it's not suitable for making depth adjustments accurate enough for bevel cuts.

That being said and this being an open-source beast, I have no doubt that someone will ditch the router base altogether and make a more CNC-like stage with Z-axis resolution and accuracy that might make the bevel cuts you're looking for.
