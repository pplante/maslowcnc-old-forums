## Plywood for frame
Posted on *2017-03-21 15:23:03* by *tmaker*

I'm at the store right now and looking at all the different plywood options.  I was originally going to buy some cheap 4x8 tongue and groove flooring thinking that the sacrificial back needs to be cheap and flat.  But I'm not sure how the rabbit ears attach so now I'm second guessing myself and wondering if I should get some better quality plywood if the ears need to be attached.  Thoughts?

I played around with the idea of using the cheap flooring with tongue and groove too. I never actually tried it, but I can't see why it wouldn't work. The structural connection to the ears is the screws through the main sheet and into the part of the ear which goes behind the main sheet so I think the groove will be ok...but like I said I haven't done it.

If you do it, let us know if it gives you any trouble.
