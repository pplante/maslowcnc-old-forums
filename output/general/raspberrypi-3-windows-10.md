## Raspberrypi 3 / windows 10 IoT
Posted on **2017-02-10 09:19:14** by **chadzimmerman**:

Ok, have my pin running windows 10IoT now.  It is a different kind of beast to work with.  Goal is to get the code running for the controller. 

Hopefully make it a little more user friendly to get going.

Awesome! Keep me posted. My Raspberry Pi 3 came and I'm just waiting on an HDMI cable to start poking at it. I'm going to start with the KivyPi disk image https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-rpi.html and see how far I can get.

Will let you know what I get to work.  I have too many little project going.. but with it being 30F outside and 10" of snow.. don't feel like going outside to work in the shop.

Would not have thought it would be this much of a pain to get working.  No luck so far in getting a python hello world to come up..

Well, the Windows route is proving to be a challenge.  I think it is going to take some changes to ground control to get it usable going this way.

Swapped out cards to Rasbian, have it up and running with Kivy installed.  I have the GroundControl able to load, but I lost mouse control and the center marker relocated to the upper right.
