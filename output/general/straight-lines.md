## Straight lines?
Posted on **2017-06-03 09:27:19** by **oglesbay**:

Hello everyone! I'm looking to buy one of these (missed out on Kickstarter) and one of the questions I have is how straight are the lines when cut (when TRYING to do a straight line)? I'm very interested in this and think it'll be a great addition to my shop. Thanks!

A few weeks ago, a horizontal line across a full sheet of plywood had a bow in the center of `1/16"

This is a software problem, and changes have been made that we think have significantly helped this, but nobody has run tests to see what the results are.

Bar mentioned in the Olivia Desk cut, that the lines seemed much more accurate, but we are waiting for someone to do a new set of accuracy tests for us.
