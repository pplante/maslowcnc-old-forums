## MDF privacy Screens

Can maslow create a full 4x8 mdf privacy screen like the image below without overheating. Can maslow run 24/7 cutting these types of full sheets?  Can it create intricate designs?

MDF is murder on spiral bits... I'd be more worried about frequent tool changes than wearing Maslow out!



Seriously, though, there's only one in existence right now with significant, but not 24/7, use. (Bar's) So the answers to duty cycle questions like that are going to be theoretical or poorly supported at best.



The accuracy of the machine is advertised at about 0.5mm so patterns like those you posted should not be a challenge at all.

I cut a good bit of that 1/4 inch MDF stuff and MDF gives you really nice clean edges. I haven't been doing a good job of keeping track of which bits get used for what so I can't comment on the tool life.



Maslow isn't really designed as a production tool to run 24/7, but I bet the first thing to fail would be the router. The motors and chains are the only moving parts on the machine and they should last a long long time.



If you are looking to make some of those for your house I think Maslow could do them no problem. If you want to start a company which manufactures them 24/7 I think you want a machine that's built for that like a Shopbot.

Good point about the router. That's something to keep in mind with any consumer-grade power tool: most are not rated for continuous use and have duty cycles in the 50% range. Universal motors are quite forgiving of this rule but there is a limit. There are commercial-grade fixed base routers out there... they are not, however, $119. :D

I would worry more about the actually MDF breaking on me if it had so many cuts in it. You might need to consider a special hold down or some sort of optimized vacuum table.
