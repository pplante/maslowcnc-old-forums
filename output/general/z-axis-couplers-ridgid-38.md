## Z-axis couplers 'Ridgid 3/8"' vs '3/8"'
Posted on *2017-02-22 19:13:26* by *jbarchuk*

The z-axis purchase page http://www.maslowcnc.com/purchasez-axis/ has a dropdown to select the coupler desired.
There's 'Ridgid 3/8"' and '3/8"' listed.
Is there a difference/distinction between them?

Ooops. That's a typo. I think we added the "Ridgid 3/8ths" to make it more clear that was the one for the Ridgid, but there shouldn't be two. Thanks for pointing that out.
