I did. I got an email earlier saying that due to paypal's rules they can't take a pre-pay through that. And that I should go through the web site to place the order, but the link doesn't work right now.

In the email from Hannah she says that we can reorder with credit card instead of paypal but the link: https://www.maslowcnc.com/superduperultrasecretsale don't seem to be working. Is it just me?

Ditto. I replied to the email. I figured Hannah will get back to it when she has time.

Had the same problem. Probably lost my place in line ;)
Was ordering a second one to play with at work.
At least I hope all the bugs will be stomped out by the time they ship.

I'm really sorry for the confusion everyone. Nobody's spots in line moved around! The problem was that PayPal called us and said that it's against their terms of service to use PayPal to preorder. They were nice about it, but they didn't give us any choice but to refund all the paypal orders which was a pretty big bummer. Again, sorry for the confusion.
