## compatible routers
Posted on *2016-10-13 17:11:36* by *mattyp*

What weight and dimensions are compatible for use as routers? Would a festool OF1400 at 4.5kg (10lbs) be too big and heavy? Or the smaller OF1010 be better?

Thank you for being the first ever forum post! You rock!

The weight shouldn't be an issue, it might even be a good thing. Most of my prototypes were done using this ancient  [Craftsman Router](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:hga3:craftsmanrouter.jpg.jpg)  that I picked up at the flea market for $10, which actually works pretty well. It's quite heavy, and that hasn't been an issue.

I'm pretty broke right now, but if the kickstarter hits its goal I will go out an buy all the major routers and test them all side by side. Festool makes beautiful tools. The dust collection on those looks especially fantastic. 

Do you already own one? How is the dust collection?

Thanks for the reply. Surprised I was the first to post. No I dont yet have a router, but have a few other festools and was thinking of one of their routers as it would fit in with the others I use - plus you get used to the quality and joy of using their tools... - and the dust collection on the tools I have (domino and track saw) is amazing! I'll wait to find them secondhand.
Im hoping a Maslow would make a great investment for building some custom furniture - and the plywood boat I've dreamed of building one day...

I have a Porter Cable 7518 3.25 hp in my router table. I suppose this would work fine too? I'd probably need to buy a fixed base for it to use with the CNC, though. I have it mounted in a router lift underneath the table. Would love to see the router do double duty!

That looks like a great router. The fixed base for that router seems to rotate the entire router to raise or lower the depth, is that right? That will still  work, but can be a little bit of a hassle to adjust.
