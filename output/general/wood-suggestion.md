## Wood suggestion.

Hey is there particular 3/4" plywood we need to use? Working on grabbing materials and the buildout of frame. Can I just get particleboard for the back sheet since it's cheapest? Any suggestions?

you don't need expensive plywood, but you do need it to be flat.
mdf works well for the sacraficial layer, but you probably want something a bit stiffer over time for the main board (mdf will tend to warp under stress over time more than plywood will)

I haven't worked with particle board at all, but I can't see why it wouldn't work. Like @davidlang said, you might find that it warps over time or has more flex to it, but if that's the case you can always just cut the parts for a new frame from nicer wood using your particle board frame.

You can get mdf in 1" or 1.5" thickness at cabinet supply companies
