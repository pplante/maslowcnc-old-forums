## Best / Flatest plywood recommended? & 1/8" metal sled?
Posted on *2017-03-24 07:51:25* by *rollandelliott*

I've got two questions #1 what is the best flattest plywood to use to make the frame. Most of my materails I cut will be very thin, 1/16 and 1/8" thick and I'd like to start off with the flattest material. obviously plywood is an organic material with random tolerances, but I'm sure some grades are better than others. local cabinet place recommended $62/sheet  poplar core with maple veneer 1" thick plywood. Might even buy some 1/4 aluminum plate, but it's expensive.  
Question #2 everyone knows that the more a router bit sticks out the more vibration & torque.  Therefore wouldn't it make sense to have a laser cut sled made out of 1/8" thick steel with some umhw strips on the bottom? My local laser company would probably make them in the $20 to $30 range.  if you are using a 1/4" router bit and having to stick it out an extra 1/2 to 3/4" inch that is a HUGE deal IMHO.

if you are using a 1/8" bit that extra 1/2 to 3/4" distance will cause many bits to break.

I have heard good things about MDF coded plywood or even using MDF itself. It's less of an organic material so it will hold it's dimensions better as long as it doesn't get wet. 

The idea of making a thinner sled to reduce force on the bit is an interesting idea, I hadn't thought about that. I haven't had a lot of issues breaking bits, but it's something to keep an eye on.

the sled is not a very large part of the weight, so making it thinner won't help much (remember, we are adding bricks to increase the weigh)

also, umhw strips are probably not a great idea, while they are slippery, they also create edges to catch on things.

even the high quality plywood can end up being warped if it's stored wrong, so what's flattest is going to vary. You will probably end up wanting to make a frame behind it to hold it flatter than the default frame, or make it a torsion box. There are all sorts of videos out there giving instructions for how to make a worksurface pefecttly flat.

I shot the pic below to demonstrate what Bar said, the organic nature of plywood. I was VERY impressed with the pure flat- and smoothness of Lowes 3/4" birch ply. 11 layers, veneer both sides, one side primed. Obviously what your local cabinetmaker has is better than that but in the US Lowes is a more common source for most ppl.
That sheet was FLAT as DUCK!!! Straight as the proverbial arrow and totally featureless.
Notide I said 'was' flat. ;) Then I mounted it on the frame and all went downhill from there. LOL!!! Maybe I used too many screws, maybe I mounted it too tight. The pic looks like ocean waves, but over the ~40" length the total error is only about 1/16".
When you said routing 1/16" that actually gave me a shiver. That's scary thin.
But that frameboard is actually the least of your worries. The total error of framboard, wasteboard, and ma terial all add up.
I think the best answer for you is to be less concerned with the frameboard and more concerned with the wasteboard because that's what the -thinnest- material, your working material, actually lies on. The wastboard flatness can -cancel- the error caused by the frameboard. But holy canolis a $60 wasteboard seems excessive. :(
I also think the size of the -sled- will have more of an effect, in a sense can help you more, than most other factors. The wavy effect in the pic is over 40". Obviously the sled isn't 40", I'm going to use about 12" to start, so the sled will ride up and down the wave and not notice the 1/16" error. It will even hold square to the working material.
I looked up UMHW and that's super interesting, if it's not excessively expensive. The mating surface between the sled and material is probably the most important factor that determines the overall friction and thus a lot of the accuracy over a length of sled travel. Especially in -you- instance where scaling this down in thickness can magnify errors.
Take into account overengineering though. One piece in the 'chain of inaccuracy' that is 100x better than any other error is nice in a theoretical sense but it can't -fix- any of those other errors. I don't know if you saw my other post about 'it just doesn't matter.' Engineer the design -- don't get all 'sciency' about it. :)

davidlang making the sled thinner doesn't have anything to do with weight savings. it has to do with the length the router bit protrudes. take an extreme example. say your sled it 1.5" thick that will create undo stress and torque on the router. the closer the router bit is to the motor the smoother things run.

I can also get full 4x8 sheets of UMHW, its about $40 for a 4x8' sheet.

you should be able to move the router down to where the nut scrapes the wood, even with a 1/2" or thicker sled. Where are you going to find a cutter that short? you don't want to try to clamp to the cutting portion of the bit.

I've sent this link many times, but I'll list it again here, consider making the sled out of something like: https://www.samsclub.com/sams/bakers-chefs-commercial-cutting-board-15-x-20/126035.ip?xid=plp:product:1:1

MDF sheets are normally very flat. They aren't nearly as strong, but if you have a strong frame and are looking for a very flat spoilboard, they work well. I agree $60 plywood is bad overkill for the frame.

davidlang: you can't move router bit pass the working surface on any handheld  router I have ever used unless you literally cut off the router housing. The housing is designed to stop at the surface for obvious reasons, under normal circumstances one never has to have the bit protrude past the horizon. the thicker the sled the worse off one is. bench top routers on the other hand are a different story.

---

Posted on *2017-03-24 11:25:08* by *davidlang*

fixed base routers are commonly used in router tables so they frequently want that extra stick-out

also the extra stick-out makes it easier to change the bit.

but in any case, you are unlikly to find a bit short enough to need that much stick-out

Every spiral upcut bit I've owned is short , I order them that way on purpose so I optimize my router. I guess if you just go to your local hardware store and choose from their poor selection that might be the case, but if you order online it's easy to find the perfect size bit for whatever material you need.

not sure what brands/models have this extra stick out, but my palm bosch, and full sized porter cable and skill routers do nto have extra stick out.. anyways I'll be making my sled as skinny as possible and suggests other do the same, can only be a benefit.

Lexan would be cool, light, strong, and cool to be able to see the cutting under the sled. And it's cheap enough to have a spare on hand.

I discovered that my basic malfunction is that the front faces of my two vertical 2x4s are not parallel. OK that's not my basic malfunction that's the machine's malfunction. My issues are far deeper rooted and much less easy to discover. ;)
That misalignment causes a twist in the plywood. @davidlang in another thread mentioned torsion box. I never heard that phrase before but understood what he meant. The idea is to add other structural pieces that counteract the problem the right amount in the right direction. I'll add a piece of 2x4 that connects the tops of t he vertical pieces. Depending on the straightness of -that- piece it'll either fix the problem or make it worse. However it'll be easy to add washers between the new piece and the vertical pieces that adjust it's non-straightness if any, -and- adjust the original problem.
This issue is more pronounced in my machine because the vertical pieces are much closer together than the standard design. It's minor in  that the error is only 1/16" but I'll fix it anyway because the material I'll be routing is only 3-4mm thick.

no, a torsion box is another term for a stressed skin panel.

Instead of having your rigidity being in the 2x4 or similar beams, it's in the thin skins of the panels. you can use thin plywood panels on each side (1/4" is all the strength you need, but you may want a thicker one on the front to make it harder to damage) and a gridwork of light wood (1/2" wood on 6-12" spacing, this wood does not need to be solid pieces) between the panels, and the resulting structure is both much lighter and much stiffer than if you tried to build it with 2x boards with one skin of plywood

a quick google search came up with this example:

Got it, thanks.

another way of looking at a torsion box is that it changes bending forces to stretching forces

when you try to bend a piece of wood, you can look at it as if you are trying to strech the outside of the bend (and compress the inside, but it doesn't really compress much, if you bend it to destruction, the outside pulls apart, unlike corrugated cardboard where the inside collapses).

It turns out that something like 90% of the strength is in the outer few percent of the wood, the rest could be pretty much eliminated without much difference to the overall strength (as long as it's strong enough to keep the outer parts moving together).  This is how I beams work.

so if you extend this concept across the entire working surface, you can have a 4-6" thick panel  where the inside is 90-95% air that is almost as strong as if it was one (massive) solid slab of wood

I can very much relate to that now. I use round and square carbon fiber rods and when possible tubes. Near-zero decrease in strength at much less weight. Nature imitates technology too! ;) Eggshells do something similar, distributing the stress around the perimeter. Skulls are essentially hollow shells and very strong. Examples everywhere... The World Trade Center was designed to send the loads to the outer skin, which has been theorised was why it didn't collapse sooner than it did. The desk I'm sitting here working at was made from a hollow door. :) It's 'twisty' but weighs nothing.
I figured out how to straighten the frame without adding any wood. I used two rows of screws running the length, but offset from the center, and staggered.  [Mcnc-06-vertical-screws](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:aiTv:mcnc06verticalscrews.png.jpg) 
The left side from this view is the side that's twisted 'away.' So, I'll add washers between the plywood and the stud on the right side to push it away and effectively pull the  left side closer. I'd rather fix the structure I have than add new structure. Yuck, more work but I'd rather have flat than think about issues later that might have to do with the wavy shape.

yep, hollow doors are a perfect example of torsion boxes, the inside is a think cardboard grid, and the outer layers are thin wood (with thicker wood around the edges, mostly to give you someplace to anchor the hinges and the knob to)

If you were to disassemble a door and stack the pieces together, you would find them extremely bendy, while the assembled door is nice and stiff.

P.S. in terms of examples in nature, Bones tend to be hollow, not solid

Yep I thought of the bone thing later. Plants. too. There's a weird woody weed here in FL only the thickness of a pencil, and hollow, but will tear the snotrag out of a model airplane if it hits a patch of them. One of mine broke slightly, a pretty big 10# plane, I was lucky it didn't tear it in half. Balsa is fragile and that stuff is much stronger.
In Asia they use bamboo for scaffolding the way we use aluminum. I saw several buildings maybe 8 stories tall literally wrapped in bamboo. Wow here are tons of bamboo scaffolding pics at google images. A little scary but I guess the workers there are used to it. Then again they 'spend' people very casually, such as a few thousand coal mining deaths each year where the USA loses a few dozen. But that's a different topic. https://www.google.com/search?q=bamboo+scaffolding&num=20&newwindow=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjnuaqEnPHSAhUQ_mMKHUipD9sQ_AUICSgC&biw=1920&bih=965#imgrc=_
*Yay!! The washer fix worked about 80%!!!!* Turns out both studs are a little twisted and there were two waves. I did the stud on the left side  and it made one wave go away completely so there was just one outward bow. Then I did the right side and the top 1/3 cleared up perfectly flat but the bottom 2/3 has a mild inward bow.
Not having planned for this, I COULD have fixed the WHOLE thing if I hadn't STAGGERED the screws. That angled the forces and makes the geometry weird, which I don't feel like doodling around with any more. I mean It -could- have been TUNED like a friggin PIANO much more easily if they were lined up parallel. There's also a fairly wide gap where there are no screws because the hinge is behind the stud, so it's a little 'untuneable' there. Oh well it's twice as good as it was, and the rest probably 'doesn't matter' (very much). ;)
Gotta learn something new every day!! :)
I know it sounds like I'm overthinking it but I know that errors and misalignments add up. Every one that can be minimised andremove will help further down the line by removing factors from the equations.
