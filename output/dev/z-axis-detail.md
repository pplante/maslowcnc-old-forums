## Z-Axis detail

I was looking at the Ridgid in Home Depot the other day and noticed that the locking mechanism allowed the sleeve to open up quite a lot when unlocked, which is required to let the router body move up and down with the fine adjustment tool that the Z-axis uses. It felt really wobbly with the latch undone and I didn't see an adjustment (I may have just missed it).

Do you have to unlatch the lock each time a depth adjustment is made? Or is there a way to make fine adjustments without unlatching? Just curious.

That's a good question. One of the reasons I chose that router is that there is a nut hidden under the latch mechanism which lets you adjust the latching force. You want it set tight enough that there is no wobble but not so tight that it is impossible to set the depth.

Latching and unlatching between every depth adjustment would get old pretty fast.

Ah. So the tension is adjustable. I probably just missed it. Thanks for the clarification!
