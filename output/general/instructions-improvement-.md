## Instructions Improvement - help for launch
Posted on *2017-03-22 13:16:52* by *rexklein*

As beta testers our job is to help Maslow succeed. Good Instructions are critical to a successful launch. 

Notes.
1. The cut list should be # matched to frame diagram. I would suggest builders number the pieces as they acre cut.
2. zoom in on pictures for all four corners close enough to see the configuration and components. 

3. I am assuming that the motors are not left and right handed but making a note of that would allay fears.

Always better to answer questions first than generate them.

Very cool suggestions. Mark EVERYTHING that's not obvious. It's not hard to figure out these things, but there's the possibility of error and waste of time figuring them out.
With a sharpie, write '1' on the left motor and '2' on the right motor JUST in case the machine ever needs to be taken apart AND there's a slight variation in the motors that could cause them to behave differently. That variation might not be seen till an hour into a cut and things start looking 'odd.'
Same reason, mark the chains 1 and 2 (a tag or piece of tape) and that tag also marks the 'stretchy cord end' of the chain.
Nothing worse than taking something apart, putting it back together, and it behaves differently for no apparent reason.

If this is a place for instruction improvement suggestions:
 - Add a wrench to the list of tools, for those nuts for the sled chain hangers. (Do those bolts _really_ need to be that long?)
 - Attach the motor mounts before attaching the 2x4 assembly to the plywood, while its easily accessible
 - When you make your sled, put a hole near the center of the top edge to hang it up. Put one of the long wood screws in the center of the top horizontal to hang the sled while attaching the chains, etc. This makes a good place to hang the end of the chain when it's not attached to the sled as well.
 - The "How To Assemble The Temporary Frame" page could use a combing out - it still refers to mounting the motors to the top edge of the plywood.

I combed out the "How To Assemble The Temporary Frame" page, made it clear that the motors are identical, and made a note to shorten those bolts (great point, in an earlier version they needed to be long but not anymore). 

I'm working on making sure there are close up pictures of the corners and numbering the cuts of the 2x4s to keep things straight.

Great suggestions everyone!

I've thought about that since day-1 too. But I couldn't think of the right way to handle it.
My concern was how to position the hanger to be convenient for the lengths the chains happen to be at the moment, to attach them to the router.
Or, wherever the mounted router happens to be at the moment, hang it easily to detach it from the chains.
Yes one can manually wind/unwind the chains to the right length, but that's time consuming.
These two pics show a bracket with a 3/4" #8 screw, and a length of random lightweight chain.
The bracket hooks over the backboard at the -horizontal- position that I want, and hooking the chain on the screw at different links adjusts the -vertical- position.
When done mounting or dismounting the router, unhook the bracket and hang it on  the back side of the backboard or some other convenient place.
It took longer to take the pics and write this text than to whip up that bracket. LOL!!!
In the second pic... Those little dark smears to the right of the bracket, that's my blood!! The saw machine at Lowes made TONS of very sharp splinters and I got stabbed quite a few times. :) I meant to brings gloves but forgot. I didn't arrange that in the pic on purpose but happened to notice it when editing the pics.

Every good project involves a bit of blood! ;)

Nope, no blood! Goal is zero blood. :-) Lowes should seriously consider open-sourcing their design/user manual. I bet they could get that splinter problem sorted in a matter of hours :-)

Please be patient with me I actually do this kind of thing for a living. please see attached screenshot add a column called leg piece it will unify all three sections giving the assembler 3 bites at the apple to understand. [2017-03-22_22-49-03](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s2/:maslowcnc:qsnG:20170322_224903.jpeg.jpg) 
people's brains work differently some are diagram oriented some are list followers. Many (especially the confident) will use the cut list first. I think you will find that once labeled the list is actually out of numerical order with respect to piece. you can actually see in the last diagram that the order is jumbled. 
Finally so you don't think I am a loon my job is to disseminate information to professional contractors  and I am constantly amazed at my failures in getting information presented in a "bullet proof " way . (i may as well go all in here if) you're going to state inches you should use fractions no common tape measure uses decimals with inches. there is a psychology component when you give a length of 10.4" you make the user have to really think about the conversion which isn't that easy this s ubtly undermines the user's confidence in the instructions that follow. Most of the complaints I get are the dumbest things you have ever heard but to the user they are not. Again I am not trying to be picky I just want rock solid bulletproof understanding.

I DO understand the angst you're experiencing! I've had several rounds of that myself with this project and it -has- been -very- painful! The shortest answer is that...... https://youtu.be/e9mf3Bypyk8
More accurately, it doesn't matter -that- much. Pretty close is probably OK. Here's a truth: 'Engineering is the science of compromise and good enough.' Science is based on angstroms. Engineering is based on 'I could keep on developing this -forever- and it -still- won't be perfect, so I have to pick a time to say  stop... it's done... it's good enough.
Except for Bar's prototype and the one vid you've probably seen of a finished 'built by design' Maslow running, nothing like this has ever been built before!! So far it works 'good enough.' You saw the vid Bar made of the many ideas, variations, and redesigns he went through. That process took months. A scientist would keep on refining and refining things and -never- finish it. But Bar had to pick a point where he said to himsel f, "I think this works well." Not perfectly, but good enough.
There are too many variables for anything like this to be perfect. Everyone building a Maslow will have slightly different results because of those variables. There's the router, the bit, the wood, all will be slightly different. Heck even if the metal and plastic parts are identical, the moisture content of the same piece of wood varies over time. The router power will vary over time as the brushes wear out! 115VAC vs 120VAC! Now if a -scientist- designed this, he'd take into account the POM effect, phase of moon. If the moon is on one side of the earth or the other it will pull slightly on the router either -into- the material being cut, or -away- from it, or sideways one way or the other, or up or down, factor -that- into the motion control, and vary -that- in 10 minute increments as the moon orbits the earth. Which is of course ridiculous to any earthbound engineer. :)
The point you made about the 10.4. I can't do trig in my head any more, lost it many years ago. By design the frame is angled at 15 deg. So, you go do the math and find the variation in the angle if that 10.4 is either 10.3 or 10.5. My WAG is that it might be as much as 1 deg. Maybe less. The point being that given all the other variables, that 1 deg won't matter much. The math behind the hardware and electronics says that it's -supposed- to be accurate to 0.4mm. Achieving that accuracy repeatedly will be a matter of experimentation, practice, and experience. A few people will get -excellent- results very quickly, post the numbers they used as regards router RPM, bit type, material used, router travel speed. Other people in similar situations will have a very good starting point from which -they- can do their experimentation and practice, and gain experience. I don't know what materials you intend to use, but wood itself is as much art and craft as science and engineering. -Every- piece of wood is different. Its characteristics vary even within the same piece of wood. The best anyone can do is start with known good numbers based on educated guess recommendations, and others' experiences, try that, and decide what they need to do to get better results.
As far as the accuracy of the frame goes, the best thing to do is try to make both a-frames as identical as possible. The engineering answer is 'if they're within 1 to 2 deg of each other they're... "    ." They're what? FITB (Fill in the Blank... They're 'good enough.' :)
Best of luck to you. Don't try to make it -too- perfect or you'll never finish building it. :)

Agree with you. My main point is that while building I am putting myself in the role of the eventual Maslow customer. .4 is between 3/8 an 7/16. Pick one and use that. One of the most common things you hear on forums about products is clarity of the instructions. I have seen many reviews where instructions are the biggest complaint. I would argue that because this is a DYI assisted project, clean easy to understand instructions are critical for success. Each question Maslow eliminates due to clear instructions is money in the bank.

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 09:20:43* by *davidlang*

just round to 10" or 10.5" (right now there's thought that performance would improve with it closer to upright)

I agree simplification is a good idea, this is why there's a beta period :-)

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 09:35:02* by *scottsm*

I like the list idea very much. That's the first thing I did for myself. 
The decimal conversion question is interesting. There is some deep math among the inner workings of this thing, and the calculations are done using metric measurements. Calibration is dramatically important, and the values will be metric measurements. This is the first project I've done that forces me to get familiar with metric measurements, and it's good experience. 
As for "it just doesn't matter", I'm right along with that :) Except where it does matter :(. I think that's what this beta test program is trying to establish, what does and doesn't matter. I've lashed up a couple different sleds of various sizes and shapes and had disappointing results. Then I went through and did the calibration and input all the measurements and settings (metric again :) ) and "YES!!!" a circle came out round and at the correct size! I think the take-away is that we need somehow to indicate what is important. Folks can make the stand any way they want, but they need to provide a couple very important measurements  about the geometry when they're done. There are a couple measurements on the sled that are important. I'll bet that there is something important to know about calibrating the motors, too. How can we indicate these things?

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 09:45:18* by *rexklein*

Maybe an approach would be 
1. color code and label (lit git does) 
2. State upfront metric is preferred, english measurements are supplied for less precise pieces.
3. Note that a metric measuring tape is required

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 09:45:57* by *davidlang*

The exact tilt does not matter.

The only value (of the frame) that is absolutly critical is the distance between the motors, and even there what matters is that what the software is told matches reality (and I believe that the calibration routine figures this out)

On the sled, there are more important values (the spacing between the chain anchors, how far below this point the router is, and where the center of gravity of the sled is), but the machine will still work with these changed, as long as the software is told what they are.

It's not at all clear that the exact values of the default configuration are the optimum values. They are ones that work, but Bar did not build lots of machines to test them, he tweaked things until they became 'good enough' and moved on to other areas.

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 10:02:01* by *mindeye*

@davidlang - Could the distance between the motors not matching reality cause the ovalization we're seeing in some of the beta machines sleds?

My own beta drew a circle 15 1/2" tall by 16 1/2" wide when I "chucked" a pencil in it (in reality I just held it against the sled while it moved around - but I'm confident my own human frailty did not cause more than an 1/8" of error).

I'm guessing my measurement on motor spacing isn't 100% correct, probably due to curvature in the plywood on the base more than anything.

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 10:06:16* by *davidlang*

bar indicated that he thought it was something else, but that's possible. The trouble is that a number of other things are possible as well (the math to figure out the exact position is complex)

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 10:08:58* by *mindeye*

My money is currently that it's a setting thing since other folks ovals are taller than wide and mine is wider than tall. Either way I'll be creating some new, faster calibration files this afternoon to test with a proper, centrally chucked drawing instrument.

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 10:20:51* by *davidlang*

Try tweaking this value (either in software or by moving the motors, especially if you are using the bootstrap setup) and see how much it affects this.

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 11:08:26* by *scottsm*

It is indeed a setting - look for 'Motor Offset Height' and 'Motor Offset Horizontal' ! They make a very dramatic difference. We _must_ get this and something about motor calibration into the instructions very soon, before folks become discouraged...

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 11:18:21* by *davidlang*

well, I would hope that people who sign up for beta testing recognize that there will be issues found and be watching the forums and updates for info.

The first week was busy, and as more people get time to assemble things, I expect that this week/weekend will be even busier.

remember, the instructions are a wiki page, anyone can update them.

Posted on *2017-03-23 11:21:59* by *blsteinhauer88*

I have my temp set up with his original deisign, motors on the corner of the 4x8 sheet.  I got great ovals.  I played with the settings last night and tried to cut circles.  I also cut the brick holders that ended up usable but with oblong ends.  I assumed It was because the motors were low and the chain needed to be at full length.  Is anyone using full length of chain setup, and still getting ovals?

I thought the oval was funny, came out like a circle.  I changed cutting direction, and speed of cut and still got same results.  some interesting shatter on the edges also.  I have the bricks installed thinking down weight would help too and it did not affect the outcome.

In your second pic, the first 'ovircle' (LOL!), those scalloped edges are super-interesting. Notice how the scallop is more pronounced along the bottom 'more horizontal' part of the cut, and the sides, more vertical, are smoother.
To me it implies a lot of friction. Instead of sliding freely the sled is hang-hang-hanging, pulling up, that's the curved part of the scallop. Then the pull overcomes the hang and the sled goes whooosh down where it -should- be, that's the point of the scallop. Lather, rinse, repeat.
>  I have the bricks installed thinking down weight would help too and it did not affect the outcome.
Do you remember Bar's vid of an early design, with about 6 bricks? They were unnecessary. Try removing a brick, and centering the one that's left. (That may block your access to the router head, so it may mean you need two lighter weights one on each side.)
But again it's about friction. A rougher sur face on the bottom of the sled = more friction. See what you can do to smooth the bottom of the sled.
If you could attach a -camera- focused on the router bit that might show better exactly what's happening.

Absolutely correct. The issue is that there are a lot of artsy/creative ppl here who don't know the meaning/implications of a dimension. They see 10.4 and look at their scale (well, their 'ruler,' techie ppl use scales. :)) and don't understand what the .4 is. Can't say 10.375 either because that makes no sense using their ruler. The number needs to be 10-3/8" because -that- makes sense to them. (I wouldn't refine anything down to 1/16" because their pencil line is thicker than that.
I'm trying to see it from the non-techie POV too. For -me- it's all easy because as  tiny tot I was already helping my Dad build stuff. I see the number 0.4" but my brain understands it instinctively as 3/8". The non-techie doesn't understand that in this instance 0.6mm isn't even within the accuracy of the hand saw they're using. all  they want to do is build it by design to have the best potential for success.
> Each question Maslow eliminates due to clear instructions is money in the bank.
Literally and figuratively true. Every Q that they don't have to answer is time not wasted. AND it builds !GOOD! !VIBES! BECAUSE the instructions are clear. https://youtu.be/mdt0SOqPJcg The big corporations have their 'technical writers' department -- Bar and associates are trying to catch up as fast as they can taking into account every suggestion they receive.

The decimal conversion question is interesting. There is some deep math among the inner workings of this thing, and the calculations are done using metric measurements. Calibration is dramatically important, and the values will be metric measurements.

And it's the USA that's holding the whole world back from total conversion to metric. Actually everything in the US -is- measured in metric, but all the packaging and descriptions of items say inches, feet, ounces, and pounds.

> This is the first project I've done that forces me to get familiar with metric measurements, and it's good experience.

I'm curious what your background and experience is? Anywhere in the tech world it's hard to not be involved with metric and imperial at the same time. I have friends with whom if I say millimeter or inch I have to also include phrases like 'thickness of a dime' of 'size of a quarter' so they have a reference they can relate to.

> As for “it just doesn't matter”, I'm right along with that ) Exce   pt where it does matter (.

I should have been clearer that most of what I wrote about was with specific reference to that 10.4 thing. That has reference only to the angle the frame sits at and has 99.9% no effect on anything.

> Then I went through and did the calibration and input all the measurements and settings (metric again ) ) and “YES!!!” a circle came out round and at the correct size!

What kind of accuracy did you have to measure things to?

Oh the worst case is gonna be with ppl who have some cheap chinese crap scale or tape. I once got a ruler (it wasn't accurate to be called a scale) at a dollar store, all I needed was a straight piece of plastic, and the 12" length was off by 1/8"!!! Duh. Crap. That kind of accuracy will cause this machine to -never- succeed. But ppl shouldn't need to buy a $30 tape measure just to find out how far apart the motors are. Hmmm...

How about as part of the calibration, instructions that say 'if the diameter of your circle is 'this' much, then adjust this measurement my 'that' much?' And a multiply factor. I don't know how hard such a factor would be to work out, or if it's even reasonably possible.

> I think the take-away is that we need somehow to indicate what is important. Folks can make the stand any way they want, but they need to provide a couple very important measurements about the geometry when they're done.

*Wiki rocks!!!* That -is- the assembly destructions (backspace... backspace...) instructions! ;) -You- already have the real life practical experience with what goes wrong when a measurement is inaccurate. By all means please add a paragraph at the -top- about how important it is, and why, to get that thought into the user's head at the beginning. Then another note later -repeating- that fact to drill it deeper into their head.

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 18:25:18* by *davidlang*

IIRC, there was a message from bar about a calibration routine that went something like:

set the sprockets of both motors with a tooth pointing straight up, put the end link of the chain over this sprocket (with the slack to the outside), start the routine to run the chain out until you have enough to hook over the other sprocket, let it run both motors to get enough over the second sprocket to get a good grip, then the machine would tension the chain between the motors.

It knows how many turns it needed to do to pay out the chain and get it over the second sprocket, then it knows how much it turned back to the point where there is a known tension of the motors, so it now can calculate how much chain there is between the motors, and since the chain doesn't stretch a noticable amount (and we can either discount or calculate sag at the known tension), we have measured how much distance there is between the motors.

I'm not in the beta group (no space to build the machine at the moment), is there such a routine? If not, it shouldn't be that hard to make one.

Posted on *2017-03-23 19:10:20* by *rexklein*

Ok this is gonna sound down right dumb but maybe we can take the guess work out with a novel Idea. For the critical dimensions which should be static why not include a couple of precut pieces of environmentally conscious stiff paper strips. I know this cause more work packaging but when I think of my fellow americans blaming Maslow for our metric issues I say take the issue away completely and just give them the "distance templates"

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 19:37:39* by *davidlang*

I think there would be enough problems with unfolding 10 ft of paper stips and getting them flat to measure it that it would invalidate the accuracy :-)

I don't think that being off by even a couple of inches  in the horizontal spacing would make as much difference as we are seeing

---

Posted on *2017-03-23 21:49:09* by *mindeye*

So I didn't have time to test messing with measurements between motors but I did play with the center of mass config for a handful of runs today. Trying to draw a 12" diameter circle, for values of 60 and 0.5 mm with just the fixed base (no router, just a pencil for marking) I got two ovals 13" wide by 9.75" tall oval. Setting it to 130 I reduced the height to 9.25". I'll try to do further testing of other config values this weekend when I get a chance.

> @rexklein
> For the critical dimensions which should be static why not....
I think the criticalness is not so much that the design tells the user what the dimensions -should- be in 'theoryland', but that the user tells the machine what they -are- in real life Flatland. Yes, given the target work area of 4'x8', the design has in a sense recommended or preferred dimensions. -Nothing- is -that- accurate though. After building, the measurement and calibration process tell the GC what the exact-exact dimensions are.
I wish I could find and either quote or name the URL of a recent post that talked about that. Someone was having repeated inaccuracies, oval shaped circles and such. Then they went back through the measurements again with much more -accuracy-, and all of a sudden the machine got more repeatably accurate.

---

Posted on *2017-03-24 07:41:08* by *Bar*

This is all fantastic feedback. Thank you. I will make the imperial units to fractions change right away.

In terms of figuring out the oval issue, I think it's at least partially a settings thing, but I want today go through my software again with a fine tooth comb to make sure everything is as it should be. I added the ability to change the machine dimensions on the fly relatively recently. Most of my testing was done with the dimensions hard coded. 

If any of the dimensions are as critical as we are seeing, I agree that including some type of template is a good idea. Ultimately I think some type of calibration routine where the machine moves to set points would be the best solution.

---

Posted on *2017-03-24 07:45:40* by *rancher*

Bar......I tried cutting with the new software yesterday.  It's a mess.  Sorry to tell you.  I think the dimension stuff really screwed it all up.  I figured out they were settable and got back to something close, but it was losing it's place, dropping out, and generally seriously struggling compared to the last iteration.  I figured I'd let things settle out a bit, but I'm available today to go do some test cuts or whatever if you need some feedback.

---

Posted on *2017-03-24 07:49:04* by *Bar*

Ok, so you think the latest software is worse than the version before?

 I'm going to start messing with the dimensions right now so we should have answers pretty quick.

---

Posted on *2017-03-24 07:53:09* by *rancher*

Well, I sure was stoked to see the corners drawn correctly!  But, well...for sure things were wacky out of the gate with the new software, I suspect mostly due to the new default dimensions settings.  I think they were all "1"?  It took me a bit to land on that, first I recalibrated and measured chains and all that since center was so far off.  Then I got to dimensions, and as others here have mentioned, some of us are metrically challenged.  My shop has no wifi so I was trying to figure out 10' in mm, and then do the offsets, and horizontal is a negative value (maybe?), and.....you get the idea.  I couldn't tell where the errors were, but I couldn't cut anything without it stopping randomly, losing it's place, trying to catch up....it was quite a disaster compared to my first tries.

---

Posted on *2017-03-24 09:58:17* by *davidlang*

@bar, cna you have the software accept the settings in either metric or imperial and then do the conversion before it's pushed to the arduino?

---

Posted on *2017-03-24 16:56:45* by *Bar*

I bet we can do that! Great suggestion. I'm going to try to fix all the issues which are preventing everyone from cutting things out first, but if you file an issue for it on GitHub I will make sure it gets changed (but probably after you've done all the conversions :-) )

I made a change today to make things a little easier which is that now instead of measuring to the corner of the plywood (which is hard) it will ask you to measure the total distance between the motors. I think the new method will be more accurate because it's just one measurement, and easier because it's more clear what you are trying to measure.

Going way back the origins of this thread, I changed the directions to have part numbers in the dimensions spread sheet along with converting all the inches measurements to use fractions. I also rearranged the cut diagram so that they are in order #1-#5 which I agree is  more clear. Unfortunately that means the one without a critical dimension is #1 so I might do it all again and reverse the ordering number. 

Thanks for all the suggestions!

I have been thinking about this measuring debate. I wonder wouldn't it just help the world if you standardized it to metric? Users will get better results if they just bite the bullet and commit to metric. My truck is english but under the hood all the good modern stuff is metric.   I bet any backer of a product like this would understand the reasoning. For those who complain just put a conversion chart in ground control to help them. That way programming ground control would be free of on the fly conversion scripts etc less things to debug.

@rexklein, imperial vs metric is not the problem, not having the measurements close enough is the problem
