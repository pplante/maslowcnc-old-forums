## The Shopping List
Posted on **2017-02-22 13:23:31** by **boandersen**:

I know I've seen it somewhere, but I cannot find it.. As a Beta Backer, I have already swept a good area in my garage, but I still need to buy 2 bricks, 2 10' 2x4s and the two sheets of plywood. I assume the 2x4s should be the best and straightest I can find, but what about the 2 sheets of plywood? What thickness? Any preference for wood? Oak? Pine?

I am pretty sure it's 3  2x4s 10 feet long.

lthomas987 is correct that you are going to want to look for two bricks, three 10' 2x4s, and two sheets of plywood. 



I've tried to make all the dimensions not critical because there can be a lot of variation from one batch to the next of lumber. I would go with the best 2x4s you can find, but a little bend won't be a deal breaker. I used 3/4 inch plywood, but if you go to the store and see that a thickness close to 3/4 is much cheaper that will work too.



We're scrambling to get instructions put together, but we might not have a full instructional video done until your kit is in the air on the way to you.

As long as we're talking shopping lists, if a person was going to buy say 2-3 router bits to get started would you suggest?  I know you're getting a lot of use out of that 1/4" 2 flute.  So that seems like a good first choice, what about an engraving bit?

---

Posted on **2017-02-23 10:31:27** by **Bar**:

The 1/4 inch two flute does 90% of the work. I think having an engraving bit is a nice thing to have also. As a third bit I would recommend a round over bit. You can't actually use it in the machine but it's really useful for adding rounded edges to your parts after you cut them.

OK, why can't you use a roundover? Offset the "part" by X inches and go around it? Seems like it would work, but I'm probably missing the obvious.

I haven't found one that doesn't have a ball bearing on the end :-). If you can find one that works I would love to get one.

---

Posted on **2017-02-23 11:22:24** by **bdillahu**:

Not sure I know why the ball bearing would be a total showstopper... might be a pain to work around, depending on the piece... just have to set the depth really carefully.



Maybe attach the workpiece with doublestick tape (or a screw in the middle) as you mention trying with something, and then remove the "outer area". Now you have a piece hanging in space that you route around.



Of course I'm just talking without trying it :-)



But in more answer to your ask:

(just a quick search for a picture... not vouching for that particular one)

Posted on **2017-02-23 11:30:52** by **Bar**:

On mine the issue was simply getting the bearing to fit into the 1/4 inch slot, but it looks like you solved that issue. Clearly I didn't look that hard.



I've got one of those on the way from Amazon so I should have it in a day or two. I'll let you know how it works.



It might still be nice to have a regular one with a bearing to do the back sides of things. It's probably faster to just do it by hand rather than trying to flip the part and get the alignment perfect.

---

Posted on **2017-02-23 11:34:20** by **bdillahu**:

Oh, I don't disagree... and I've got one with the bearing I've used a lot (actually killed one when the bearing came apart - maybe I should have kept it for trying on the CNC :-)) - 



I'm just contrary with trying weird things, and my skills at handholding routers seems to never be good.

---

Posted on **2017-02-23 11:39:16** by **davidlang**:

just a note that looking on the shopbot forums they seem to be moving from using a 3/8" bit to using a 1/2" bit as their workhorse.



They also tend to cut a lot deeper than bar does (it's common for them to do full-depth cuts) and their machines can move a lot faster than the maslow.



I expect to use a 1/2" bit as my default.



if you remove the bearing, the remaining nub is usually int he ballpark of 1/4", and many people remove the bearing and cut off the remainder to use in router tables.

I googled bits just to look at dimensions and this was on the first images page. https://www.toolstoday.com/p-5139.aspx?searchEngineName=plunging-round-over-router-bits

Maybe 'plunging  roundover' is a subtype.

Remove the bearing was my first thought, and grind off the remaining shaft.

Yes, "plunging..." usually means it has no bearing surface. It also means that where appropriate, the bit will cut in the downward stroke when plunging as well. Removing the bearing from a bit designed to have one on the end won't have cutters on the end and therefore can't plunge blind. (without a pilot hole)

My  [roudover bit](/images/ZH/VQ/ZHVQ_roudoverbit.jpg.jpg) came over the weekend and I gave it a go this morning on a sheet of 3/4 AC plywood (because that was what was already loaded on the machine).



The  [results](/images/nI/rG/nIrG_results.jpg.jpg) look pretty good.



Because the bit I ordered was a 1/2 inch radius round-over, the bit left a 1/4 inch high square in the middle of the 3/4 inch thick cut out.



The bit had a maximum spindle speed of 18,000 rpm which is less than the 23,000 rpm I usually run and at 25ipm it seemed like it was cutting a little faster than the bit wanted to so cutting roundovers might be a little slower than straight cuts, but that's ok.



Thanks for finding that, I think playing a-round with more types of bits opens up some interesting possibilities.

Posted on **2017-02-27 13:26:06** by **davidlang**:

did you do the cut in one pass? or did you work your way down?



as you were cutting at or over the speed that the bit wanted, did you have any positioning errors showing up, or was it still cutting, just not as cleanly as it should have?

---

Posted on **2017-02-27 13:29:51** by **Bar**:

I did .15 inch passes. The final tolerances were +-.15mm of true but the bit was chattering a little which is what made me think it probably would have been happier a little slower. The finish on the curve is actually really good for being cut from AC plywood.

Is there a particular 1/4" end mill bit that is recommended?  I'm curious how long these things last as well.

---

Posted on **2017-02-28 15:25:26** by **Bar**:

I buy the ones home depot sells. They work well, but I haven't tried enough other types to say how much better or worse they are. 



Mine usually last about two weeks cutting at least one thing a day which seems pretty reasonable to me. I haven't had any fail catastrophically, usually a project comes along (like the material testing update) where I think using an old beat up bit might bias the results so I'll get a new one.

Two thoughts:

1.) Is it possible to sharpen router bits to extend their life? Those roundovers are pricy so extending their life even a little bit would be hugely valuable. 

2.) In my mind I'm seeing some sort of grid (on the wiki) that shows speed and feed recommendations for different materials and bits, or maybe even a little web app that lets you pick a bit, and a material and the app spits out a recommended speed/feed. Don't know how to create it, but there is certainly something to muse over. :)

This technique is obviously on for bits that have a 'flat' such as profiles. I wouldn't have thought that it'd be this easy. https://www.familyhandyman.com/tools/routers/how-to-sharpen-a-router-bit

Spirals. This is a little trickier but still definitely home-doable. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx5EwsEX-G4

Similar to your plywood grades Q, a 'valuable information links list' in the wiki would be a great resource, such as sources for the diamond files required to do this. It needs to be done by someone with the experience to pick the good references and not the hosers. (That's not me.)

The wood cutting speeds reference is a different thing. The wikipedia milling reference page lists about 20 different metals, but wood is just 'wood.' That's where user experience over time for different kinds of wood could be added. (Unless an experienced router geek can say 'wood is just wood.')

A chart may be useful for out of the box sharp cutters, however you may find that a speed rate that once worked will start to burn the material later down the road. 

On sharpening cutters, it is possible to maintain an edge yourself with diamond stones, files or cards. But it is extremely difficult to sharpen a blunt cutter (as opposed to a dull one). Part of the difficulty is in keeping the cutter edge flat on the stone.

If you ask around you will find a sharpening service that offer a collect and return service. I pay about â‚¬5 per cutter plus post. I generally send 3 or 4 blades and 3 or 4 cutters at a time. Obviously this means having duplicates of cutters so you are not without while they are being done. 

You will find that ply can be really heavy on cutters, particularly cheaper ones. Buy in bulk if possible or buy quality and resharpen.

> A chart may be useful...

Your whole post is -exactly- the kind of info the wiki is useful for. For first time tries, start 'here.' Then as people have experiences both good, bad, and fixes, record them. Everyone after that learns from it.

if you buy them off of ebay or aliexpress.com you can save a lot of money on router bits. I'd recommend nothing thicker than 1/4" diameter cutting edge, you can get bushing adapters on aliexpress as well to fit smaller bits into a larger 1/2" shank.

I think you'll find you need a tool grinder for spiral flutes and the like on end mills. The plunge cut sharpening is much like a twist drill, you need to get the specific angles ver accurate. Here's a video of an end milk being ground in a tool cutter grinder. A specialist machine for sharpening almost anything in the tool room. Note: first 2:30 of video just shows how parts move, from there it is more interesting. I bet you turn the volume down lol. That particular machine is $AU4895.   https://youtu.be/zkh7PE8clCo
