## noob question on router bits
Posted on **2016-11-27 17:59:31** by **boandersen**:

I'm kind of new to woodworking - I had an old router and always bought the cheap sets of bits for it and never got good results. Now I am waiting for the Maslow CNC and I did buy the recommended Ridgid router - but can someone suggest quality bits that would work well for this purpose?

There are a lot of good options out there, but if you are looking for something you can buy locally I've played around with these http://www.homedepot.com/p/Diablo-1-4-in-Up-Spiral-Router-Bit-DR75101/204073552 which you can get at Home Depot and they work well. 



You can find cheaper ones on Amazon or Ebay but the quality can vary.

Is the R2200 the same as the R22002? My home depot lists r2200 as discontinued and there is now only the R22002. Just curious as to what model you got Bo.

I believe that they are the same router from what I can find online. My guess is that they made some slight upgrade to the internal electronics and designated it as version two. Thank you for pointing that out, I'll keep an eye on it.

chinese router bits are a few dollars and just as good as ones I've bought in usa, which might have been from china anyways.

the diameter of your router bit should be about half the thickness of the material you are cutting. so if you are routering 1/4" wood panel a 1/8" router bit gives you the least resistance and is strong enough to not break.

the chinese website above sells adapters for using 1/4 or 1/8 diameter router bits in larger 1/2" routers

When dealing with router bits, you get what you pay for.  You pay cheap you are getting cheap.  It is worth paying that extra to get a good quality bit.  



I would highly recommend not going to a 1/8" shaft.  You will find them snapping easily.  Unless you are cutting thin material, you are going to be doing at least 2-4 passes to cut through.  This will burn up cheap bits.



Even with good quality bits, I have to swap out and resharpen on a regular basis.

not true at all. the whole reason I found out about the high quality low cost chinese bits is because I was buying them for a usa reseller who charged a 10x markup and had the gall to ship them directly from china.

instead of bashing all low costs bits give specific examples of bits that are good or bad, generalizations help no one

You also have to do the math, if a cheaper bit last 1/4 as long as a "expensive" bit but costs 80% less its better to go with cheaper bit and no deal wtih the hassle of resharpening which is pretty much impossible anyways for upcut bits since the cutting surface is a side spiral.

One example would be the Skill bits I use.  I can get one large piece cut (out of 1/2 of a 4x8 sheet).  Before I have to let it cool off and sharpen it back up.  With my Rockler bit, I have yet to resharpen it.  And I have been using it three years.



Not bashing the low cost bits, just giving a bit of buyer be aware.  My wood working mindset is that I should not have to replace a tools any time soon.  :)  Well, ok.. did have to replace my miter saw well before I wanted too.. but my daughter drove over it..

those aren't specific examples, within a brand like rockler there are hundreds of router bits, some of them are cheap High speed steel some are more expensive carbide, and they wear out at different rates with different material.  carbide tends to last longer. I"ve used 1" long 1/18" bits to cut 3/4" thick HDPE plastic and I break a lot of them but I still use them vs 1/4" bits because they cut faster and make less mess.

one has to do testing and find out what bits are good for them on the material they use.
