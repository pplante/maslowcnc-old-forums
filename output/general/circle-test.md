cut a 24 inch circle. Measure the circle when cut was done. Vertical up-and-down Measure 24. Horizontal left- and- right was a little bit smaller than 24. What number do I have to adjust in setting to make the horizontal little bit bigger?

see the machine calibration step in the ground control software. It walks you through cutting a test shape, measuring it, and adjusting the number for the spacing between the chain mounts to dial it in. (I don't remember which way to adjust it to make things a smidge wider)
