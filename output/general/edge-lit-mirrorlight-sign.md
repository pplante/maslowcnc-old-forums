Ok cool kids, I haven't received my maslow yet, so I'm throwing out this project idea to see if somebody beats me to it...

These are both super cool, but who wants to do hand engraving with a dremel when you could just CNC?&quest;  And of course Maslow would make a big version totally possible.

Has anybody tried cutting acrylic with Maslow yet?  Shouldn't be any different.  Follow-up, has anybody tried engraving acrylic?  Seems like a great Maslow application - make some big ol edge-lit art pieces/signs.

as long as you keep the protective film on the acrylic while cutting into it, you should be good. you do need to experiment a bit, acrylic can shatter if the cutting tool catches it just right.

Nice, good tips.  I'm sure a conservative speed and depth with the right size bit needs to be optimized.  Ima doit.
