## how to mount sharpie marker into 1/2" router collet?

I'm going to be doing some testing, once I get my machine going and figured it would be cheaper and faster to just do some pen plots instead of cutting wood. Anyone figure out how to install marker into this router? Not going to pay $40 for the commercially made widget works gadget which just looks like 1/2" brass tube anyways.

remember that if you have a manual z, you would just have the machine pause for you to move the pen in contact with the wood or not, so you don't need to mount it in the router.

Sharpies are a fixed length, but most pencils can easily be shortened and will fit into a 1/2" or 1/4" collet.

I had various attempts with felt pens. All disappointing. The reason for me was that I can't get a sheet that is straight, so if there bow to the inside, the sled will touch the outer edges and the pen will not mark the surface. Having Z aggressively down would ware off the pen fast and cause a friction that make measurements unusable. If i was to try again i would replace the router with some sort of ring with equal weight and mount the pen with a light spring.

Engineered products like laminated MDF should be about as flat as you can buy if 3/4", sitting on a good frame

My experience with felt pens is similar to @gero’s. Pencils don’t mark dark enough and go blunt too fast. I’ve found that gel pens work acceptably and come in various point sizes and colors.
I replace the router motor with a stack of wood disks with a brass tube down the center. I fasten the pen in a smaller tube that telescopes inside, and follow that in with a spring attached to give the pen point light pressure when z is negative and to lift the pen when z is positive. I’ve found a spring size that works through 20mm of z travel, so I can pre-flight a file without needing to change the z settings to protect the pens.

anyone know where I can get a spring at? I could order several different kinds on mcmcaster carr, to experiment with but at that point I might as well buy a commercially made pen holder due to price.

My local hardware store (DoItBest) has a big enough selection that I found several to try. Seems like they were $1 or so.  The auto parts store might have something as well. A hobby shop for the brass tubing, the hardware store didn’t have the larger sizes.
