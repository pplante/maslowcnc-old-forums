## Schedule?
Posted on *2017-05-06 14:05:39* by *jwolter0*

Last I heard, the schedule is running about a month behind what was published on Kickstarter, which is not bad at all.  I just wanted to check and see if that schedule is still looking doable, and also check how the donated kits fit into that schedule.  I'm guessing that they would be at the tail end of the Kickstarter fulfillments.  We've started building our Deluxe Stand, but we only meet for a few hours once a week, and there are plenty of other projects to distract us.

Nothing very exciting has changed since the update a couple weeks ago (nothing exciting is good :-) ), and everything is on schedule.

I believe that the donated kits will go out with the second batch of kickstarter kits, but I need to check with Hannah to be 100% sure.

If you are working on building the frame ahead of time I would consider holding off a week or so more because I'm working on a redesign of the assembly process taking into account everything we've learned from our beta testers so it might be worth giving that a glance before finishing your build.

Will just the directions be changing to clarify things or will the final product be different in some way?

I think by incorporating some of the awesome ideas from everyone's builds we can make the whole build process simpler and end up with a better machine. I'm playing around with a design which trades off buying an extra 2x4 for a simpler construction process with fewer parts to cut.

First I'm looking at removing the middle brace from the legs which makes it so we don't have to cut 8 plywood pieces.  [New Legs](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s1/:maslowcnc:Lbku:newlegs.jpg.jpg) 

Second, I'd like to replace the arms with 2x4 sections. This lets us angle the motors so that the forces on the motor bracket and plywood which the motor is attached to is in plane with the wood (it's strongest direction). The result is an arm which is very rigid, very easy to build, and which has more chain wrapped around the sprocket. I'm testing it now so I'll have more to report for my update on Wednesday, but my initial impression is very good. The chains especially seem to feed noticeably cleaner.

Here's the key question.  Is the build plane angle staying at 15 degrees?

At the moment yes, it is. I haven't done as much testing of different angles as some others, but as far as I know I haven't seen conclusive evidence that a lower angle is better.
