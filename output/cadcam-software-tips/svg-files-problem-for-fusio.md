## Svg files problem for fusion 360
Posted on *2017-06-11 16:00:41* by *mikeberg*

I downloaded svg files from github.com for making the real frame but when I imported these files to fusion 360 on my stock 4x8 sheet of plywood the outer lines was tiny tiny and I have to refer to a good scale for making the final pieces perfectly like everyone ,dimensions can be helpful

if you import the "All_Parts_Laid_Out.svg" filr you can select a scale of 100 in the import dialogue box in Fusion. it ends up offset from Fusion's 0x0 plane by a bit, but you can either move it from there or ignore. As you set 'machine 0' in CAM mode, which based on what GC expects, is the center of the 4x8 square it ends up centered in GC.  hope this helps.

96x more bigger should be more appropriate, the sheet unscaled with is components on it measure 1 inch long
