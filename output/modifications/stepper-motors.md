## Stepper motors
Posted on **2017-05-28 21:11:49** by **mrjeggles**:

has anyone done a build using stepper motors? If not are there specific reasons for not using them?

thanks.

I think the torque is beyond the normal limits for stepper motors.

there's the torque but also the fact that a worm gear configuration provides a natural braking mechanism. With stepper motors you'd have to always power the motors and when not powered the sled/router would drop to the bottom.

cost of motors big enough, accuracy of motors (these motors measure 8148 steps/rev, steppers commonly measure 200), more expensive drivers, different software to run them.



lots of reasons that switching to steppers is a major effort.

Thanks everyone, I won't take that path then!
