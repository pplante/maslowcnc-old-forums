## Cut Requests
Posted on *2016-10-27 08:12:48* by *Bar*

I've gotten a couple requests to cut particular files as a way to test the machine. We had a conversation going in the kickstarter comments section, but I wanted the conversation to have a real home where we can post files and pictures and where our responses won't get lost in the rest of the comments. We've got a couple requests queued up. 

This is the order in which I am going to tackle them. 

First, I want to get the z-axis finished. It's something a lot of people requested to see. I'm done with the hardware (prototype) and finishing up the software on it so it will take me 1-2 more days to get it done and make a quick youtube video about it.

Second, I'm going to cut out some "ships/sea monsters recreated in SVG format from the Pirates of the Spanish Main card game". I already have the file (thank you :-) )

Third, I'm going to do a 90 minute chair. You can see the design here: http://atfab.co/?portfolio=90-minute-lounge-chair . This is going to be a big project, and I will definitely need to solve some bugs before it's finished. Expect that one to take a while, bu t I'll keep you up to date on what issues I'm encountering and how I am fixing those bugs. I think this is a great choice of project because it involves a lot of large pieces, from separate sheets, which need to fit together snugly. The best way to find bugs is to try something challenging. Please keep in mind as we're working through bugs that we are 3 1/2 months away from beta testers so having bugs at this point is normal. Part of being a totally open project is that we can't hide anything which can be scary, but it also makes you do better work because people are watching :-)

Thanks for the suggestions and getting involved!

Thank you Bar, good stuff!

That's a really cool design. I've sat in something similar that a friend knocked together on a whim... it was more of an Adirondack style but it was surprisingly comfortable!

This is my request (I posted this on the comments in KickStarter): http://atfab.co/?portfolio=90-minute-lounge-chair

The chair is an open design, requires precision to make across all of the parts (or else your fit will be sloppy), uses the bulk of two sheets of plywood which would demonstrate accuracy across almost a width width sheet (not quite all the height, but it can't be perfect), and demonstrates some techniques that would highlight the Z-axis (hole bores, partial depth cuts (See the side keys that are "inlayed").

This design sums up 99% of the use cases I would have for Maslow.  If it can do this, it likely can handle anything on the atfab.co website, along with cabinetry, jig manufacture, and gear making (though I may still use my current CNC for gears due to my tooling already being setup).

Something from http://sketchchair.cc/ would be awesome, and would show repeatability and precision :)

Hey Bar I love this CNC, I would like to request a cut that will show off the accuracy of this machine. If you could show us an inlay that was cut on the Maslow to show off that 1/64 tolerance that would be amazing.

Very cool! 1/64th is really pushing the edge of what I'd consider a reasonable amount of error to do an inlay like that. That kind of carving/inlay work is really where you get your other $14,000 out of something like a shopbot. I'll give it a go, but that's a tall order :-)

Haha I was not expecting that inlay, just an example I found. Trust me I understand the intent of this CNC. I plan on making furnature. I am super happy that I am able to support this project on kickstarter. The reason I asked about inlays is I have a router as well as a rotozip that I would like to try and use for more intricate detail.

Any update on cutting one of the chairs?  I'm excited to see how that turns out.

VERY COOL, THANKS VERY EXCITING!

I haven't touched the chair at all unfortunately. I've been so busy I haven't had a chance to get to it, but knowing that you guys are still interested I'll make it a priority

Thanks. Especially with the new sled rotation code I think this is totally possible

Hey everyone! I'm drafting this week's update (with a chair from Opendesk) an I wanted to check in with y'all first. The way this thread began was that there was a request in the KS comments for something from Opendesk. I asked if they wanted to see anything in particular and the 90 minute chair (https://www.opendesk.cc/atfab/90-minute-chair) was the choice. 

When I prepping to make it I realized that I really don't like it very much. It's big and blocky and kinda looks like it would be easier to make on the table saw, so I decided to do this chair (https://www.opendesk.cc/regaliz/slim-chair) for the update instead. I think it's a little more elegant, takes more advantage of some design elements that would be difficult to replicate without a CNC, and seems like something I will actually use. But...it's not the 90 minute chair that was originally asked for, so I want to propose a compromise. 

Would everyone be OK with me doing the Slim Chair and the Studio Desk (https://www.opendesk.cc/lean/studio-desk). That way I would get a desk and a chair that I actually want to us e, and we can test cutting both something big and something thin and elegant. There's also another reason which is that the people over at Shaper CNC did the Studio Desk as their show piece and they had to cheat and use a table saw for the long cuts (because holding the router by hand for the long cuts would be tedious) so I want to show building the same thing with just one press of a button.

If y'all still really really want to see the 90 minute chair I can do it.

What are your thoughts?

Sounds great to me. I like the slim chair better too and would love to see it made. And given that I know somebody buying the Shaper, I like the idea of having a comparison video to send them. :)

Just piping in to say that the Studio Desk is the first thing I want to make once I get my hands on the Maslow so I'd love to see it. (But I'm also late to the game a not a backer.)

Seems good to me!

it's always better to build things that you will use.

---

Absolutely and that chair and desk seem way more practical than the 90-minute chair.  Also way less ugly.  I was just nudging the original requester's question.   I'm much more excited about those projects.

---

I want to see Bar's office completely furnished with CNC furniture off the maslow :D Yes, I like the slim chair better too.

I think the only unique thing about the 90 minute chair is that one bit of joinery, which is 3D printed anyway.

Oh I'm going to do my whole house ;-)

Pictures and video of the chair are in the update, but I thought I'd post them here too, because this is where the idea began.

And here's a link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2d5bcTN5Qs

Thanks for bringing the OpenDesk idea back to the surface. It was a fun project, I'm looking forward to building more of their stuff.

Funny story about metric conversions: the only time I had to formally reprimand one of the ME's in my department is when he ordered over $5,000 in bracketry for an install where he accidentally converted using 24.5mmm per Inch instead of 25.4... luckily the machine shop caught it about half way through and we only ate a tiny fraction of the total cost.

So Bar, How long did it take to cut the chair not including restarts for tripping and such?  I am guessing from watching the light the video it was many hours.   I am very impressed with how the chairs came out.  I presume it all fit together as planned both in regular and elementary schooler sized?

---

Posted on *2017-01-26 19:08:40* by *Bar*

I would guess the whole process took about 4 hours, maybe more. I think you could cut that down a LOT with a more aggressive feed-rate/plunge combo. I did some tests to see how much more you could push the limits https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGSYVikWs3g . 

I'm pretty confident you could get the whole chair in under an hour once I've got all the kinks worked out.

Everything did fit together well. It's always a magical feeling to have something press fit. I like the idea that it's elementary schooler sized :-)

That's actually fantastic 4 hours isn't terrible, one hour would be fantastic!  Yep school chairs come with various seat heights 12", 14", 16", and 18" to hold kids from kindergarten to HS are the most common.
