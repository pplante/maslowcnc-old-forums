Been working on a redesign of an open desk bench.  Turned out cool! [IMG_0554](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:5uKA:img_0554.jpg.jpg) [IMG_0555](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:ASVv:img_0555.jpg.jpg)

looks very nice! how long did it take to make?

That looks awesome!  I'm still struggling.  I've spent the last two days trying to get something useable and I'm still having loss of position, drifting, GC crashing on 'home', and code handling issues.  I'm going to try again today with slower feedrates.

I'd love to know if anyone has had any success with complex cuts generated in Fusion.  I'm still wondering if it's me or it, but I am way off and getting lots of errors.  I'm truly encouraged to see a finished thing.  I'm just about out of test material and reluctant to waste good material at this point.

That looks amazing! So so so cool. Thank you for sharing it, definitely made my day. 

Was the 700kb file that wouldn't open part of the bench? 

@rancher It's not you!!! If you are stuck somewhere it's never your fault. My goal is to make everything as easy to use as possible, if you are struggling then it's not easy. Whenever you hit a bug or see something which is confusing, please please please file an issue on GitHub. Your feedback makes a HUGE difference in making sure I'm working on the right things.

I'm on my way down to try some new gcode now.  If I'm still struggling, I'll let you know.  I suspect I just don't know how to CAM correctly.

Yes it was back, with the lettering and the design.  I just cut letters first and then cut the back in separate codes.  It was a few days to put together.

ok I can't wait to get there. Nice job!

All in all, what do you think the cut time was like?

Mason Bee Hotel! Nice circles! 5 5/8 x 5 3/4, close! Still oval by 1/8 inch short length wise.

Nice!

Wow, very nice job! Good example on what you can create with layers.

Everyone is working hard testing. Let's see some projects. I tested how large a circle for a buddy's gym. It is off by about .5 inch tall. Also lines of code we're close to 18000. It came out very nice! [IMG_0690](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:td5U:img_0690.jpg.jpg)

it does look nice. what is the layered design you made before this for? a birdhouse?

Woah! Looks fantastic!

@rollandelliott, Yes! A mason Bee house. You fill the open cavity with paper straws and the move in.

blsteinhauer88, can you please share the gcode used to generate your bench?

---

Posted on *2017-05-07 12:34:02* by *rancher*

I've been struggling with the g code on this address sign project I've been working on, but today had some success.  I had a bad run on the other, "good" side of this stock, so this one gets a little weird in the ant damage there, but I'm okay with it.  I originally wanted to do it as a relief, using pocket operations, and tried positive and negative versions.  All were too much and choked any software I used.   I was barely able to get this to process, but after a week of struggling, I have something.  It is still pretty rough, but that suits me.

Wow love that

Yeah, that's gorgeous!

Beautiful!

I agree a relief would of been awesome. maybe pour some black paint to really make the relief stand out? wonder why the relief did not work?

It was too difficult for any of the software to handle.  Even when I broke it up into parts.  Fusion took me a few days to figure out exactly what was going on, then I would click once on my selection, go to town for a few hours, come back and it would be highlighted, then click to process operation, go build a fence for half a day, come back and it would be almost done processing.  Stuff like that.  Then, when I would get it to the machine, there were too many lines, so I broke it up more.  Then it was too much for maslow and it drew lines all over the place.  Makercam would choke and firefox and explorer would crash.  Ground control couldn't handle it.  I could go on and on.   I gave up entirely, but finally came back around and just did this to get it off my list.
