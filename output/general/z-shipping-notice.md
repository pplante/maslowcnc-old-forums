## Z Shipping notice
Posted on **2017-07-12 13:20:59** by **mooselake**:

Received an order shipped email for my Z axis on 7/10 with a tracking number that's been (and still is) at label printed since June 20th.   I thought the Zs would be in the box with the full kit to save the extra postage and didn't think too much of it.

If rewards were shipped by backer order (I hope; I'm number 11) then the box should have made the first truck and hit the moose swamp by now;  they made it to backers not too far from here several days ago.  Could the swamp rats have made off with it? :)

Sorry for the confusion! You are far from the only person wondering this.

I wouldn't get too worried just yet, here's why. The tracking numbers come from our system instead of from Kickstarter so they are generated when the zaxis was packed which was quite a while before USPS actually came to get the boxes. By the time they did come to get the boxes we had such a mountain of them that it took a couple days for them to get everything (with a weekend in between) so it's very reasonable that your machine is in transit. At this point every batch one kit has been picked up, and many of the batch two kits have also so if you don't get it in the next four or five days we can start to worry :-)
