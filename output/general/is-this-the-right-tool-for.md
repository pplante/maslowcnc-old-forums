## Is this the right tool for the job?

I was wanting to build a table that looks like...

I drafted up a design in autocad and ended up with weird angles like 59 degrees on the side. Being that i have a cheap table saw thats a pain to use especially for large sheets of wood i started searching cnc machines since they seemed easier and have a broader range of projects. My concern is the ability of the maslow to make long straight lines and also not badly chip away the wood on the side.  I am thinking of ether trying the maslow or spending the money on a better table saw what are your guys thoughts?

the maslow is currently in the beta test stage (the beta customers have their kits and are building machines and testing them), things are changing rapidly so we don't really know how things are going to settle out.

But it looks like it would do a pretty good job for this sort of thing. They aren't going to be available for several more weeks, so if you need something now, a maslow is not going to be your best option, but check back in 3-4 weeks and see how things stand.

There may be additional delays in availability due to the waiting list for the post-kickstarter machines.

A CNC (of any make) is not the right tool for that project. Yes, it could be done but a table saw would be better in every way I can think of.

Depending on how it's dimensioned, a sliding compound miter saw may even suffice.

Delta and Ridgid both have table excellent saws in the sub-$800 category and can be had for around $500 when sales/coupons are applied.

I agree with @davidlang on the current ability of the beta machines. Making accurate cuts the full length of a 4x8 sheet isn't there yet, but improvements are being made daily. However it could cut that project in sections without issue. 

I haven't seen any issues with tear-out or bad chips on my Maslow. That ultimately depends on the wood used, type of router bit, along with the feeds and speeds of cuts.

Looking at your project, it could be cut using a CNC, table saw, or even a hand saw. It comes down to a personal preference. My preference for a CNC is due to my lack of fine woodworking skills yet I desire to design and create ornate projects. With that said, I'd buy the CNC then build a nice sled for the current table saw. :) 
Good luck with you project, it looks cool!

+1 for miter saws (or table saw + miter sled) for this job. I've got a garbage miter saw but crucially paired it with a digital angle gauge and I routinely get very precise miter cuts out of it. With the right distance stops setup from the saw you could probably whip all the pieces for this table out in a few hours. If you got clever by joining planks together and had a sliding miter saw with the right length of cut you could do it even faster.

I  agree that this looks like a table saw and miter sled â€“ type project.
 To me, Maslow seems better suited to irregularly shaped parts.

Thinking outside the box. Replace the Router of the MaslowCNC with a small counter rotating 5" saw where the Z-axis then lifts the saw up after a cut. You could load up a sheet of wood and cut strips automatically all all day. Being a counter rotating saw it would leave nice clean cut (almost laser cut) lines.

the problem would be in making it so that the movement of the sled and the angle of the blade match. The sled tilts as it moves across the workpiece, so you would have to add a motor/sensors/software to rotate the sled depending on what direction it's moving (and deal with changing direction)

The sled with bearings could handle the tilt. Panel-saw sled!

Scottsm, "The sled with bearings"
That is exactly what I am working on using Unistrut and "U" pulleys with bearings. I want the router on my MaslowCNC to not need to use the wood as support but to glide over the surface. Still a work in progress but should be finished by the time my Non-Beta MaslowCNC shows up.

Very interesting, I look forward to seeing some pictures :).

Thats a bit disappointing was hoping this was a sliver bullet able to do everything just at a slower pace. Guess its table saw shopping time :/

In a couple of months, I think it will be able to satisfy your requirements, but it's not there yet.
