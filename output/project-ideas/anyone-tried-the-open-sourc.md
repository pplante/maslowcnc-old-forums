## Anyone tried the Open Source Beehives?

I was wondering if anyone has or is capable of testing out their Maslow CNC router on the beehive designs found at opensourcebeehives.com

Those are interesting. They have some garden equipment plans (planters, etc.) [as well](https://akerkits.com/collections/source-files) .

Thank you @cat2phat for sharing this! I have 1 or 2 colonies of wild bees every year in my trees, for a couple of months. They are kind of open-source though. They make their hive out of them self. I wonder if they would move into a such beautiful villa, if I hang it in the tree.
Thank you @scottsm for pointing on the garden equipment plans! I would have missed that.
With the Arduionos and R-Pis in place for automating hydroponics and aquaponics, it was the structural inspiration I was missing. With the Maslow it all comes together.

Thanks for sharing that, I've been interested in beekeeping for a long time, this gives me fresh impetus to a) get to grips with my Maslow system when it arrives, and b) get some hives built in time to start a course with me local beekepers guild and get the hives set up.
