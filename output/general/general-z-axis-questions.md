## General Z-Axis questions...
Posted on *2017-05-31 13:02:33* by *irwinger*

I have just run across the Maslow CNC and am totally intrigued by it's size and potential. However - having owned a desktop CNC for the past few years - I have a few questions about it that pertain to the Z-Axis control.

1) routing an outline requires holding tabs from the piece being created/routed and the blank - how did the original or non-Z-axis version would manage this? 

2) It appears that Z-axis is done through manipulating (rotating) the dept adjustment on the router; on all of my routers - the depth is adjusted and then the router is clamped in the base. In order to be able to make programmatic changes - that 'clamping' of the motor for depth can't be used - and now, we have potential sloppy holding - no?

3) Based on the fact that the router base slides along the actual 'blank' - I am going to assume that the Maslow CNC is really only capable of 2.5D and not real 3D. I think I'm stating the obvious - but I don't want to assume anything.

Thanks to all you active users - I look forward to your responses.

Welcome, Bill!

1) without a Z-axis kit, the software will pause at a depth change, ask you to change it, then you resume cutting. For tabs this would be... cumbersome. :)

2) The clamp on most routers can be adjusted so there's a slip fit between the base and spindle. The trick is to get it tight enough to prevent wiggle but loose enough that the motor can still overcome that friction. I don't have hands-on experience here, but I'm under the impression that the torque from the motor is significant and the thread on the adjustment mechanisms are usually fairly fine, resulting in a significant mechanical advantage leading to a fairly tight fit.

3) Yes, exactly. Bar has described it as such. ("2.5 D") There have been discussions around a modified router base and permanently mounted base supports that would suspend the router over the piece, allowing true 3D carving but I'm not sure anyone has breached that topic in practice.
