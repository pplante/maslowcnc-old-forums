## Anyone else from Massachusetts? (Plus a random picture of my R2D2)

I am in Franklin, and was wondering if we had any other Bostonian builders?  Here is a picture of what I am working on.  It's fiberglass, wood, aluminum, and LOADS of 3D printed parts.  Still not done.

Shiny! That is quite the R2! Are you planning on making it remote controlled? That would be a lot of fun :)



I'm based in Norwood, so I'm not all that far from you at all. I'm one of the Kickstarter backers so I won't be getting my kit until the end of the month (?) Mostly I've been lurking on this forum to follow the beta process while I eagerly await mine. I've been working on the designs for a steel frame (similar to MexicanMillionaire's) so that I can use the machine as a plasma cutter as well. Hopefully I'll be done with my drawing package and share it with everyone here!
