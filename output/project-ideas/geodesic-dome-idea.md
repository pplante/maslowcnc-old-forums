## geodesic dome idea
Posted on *2016-12-14 11:57:34* by *nathanmiller*

Do you think this same design for a laser cut geodesic dome could be done on a large scale, with 3/4" OSB (instead of the small scale thin plywood they're using)? It boggles my mind that they've set things up to literally snap together! This could be a game changer if a structure could be engineered large enough to create, say a greenhouse, or shop, or shed! And with all the smaller, narrow pieces that connect together, it could be produced with very little waste per 4x8' sheet.

Oh man!!

What a cool idea!!! 

I cut a quick piece to test the press fit idea and getting parts to press fit enough that they are hard to pull apart is pretty easy. Here's a picture  [Press fit](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:MVFF:pressfit.jpg.jpg) of the part press fit onto some 3/4 plywood.

I've found that 3/4 plywood has quite a bit of variation in thickness from one batch to the next, but the sheets within a batch are all pretty consistent so I'd recommend buying all your wood in one go for something like this.

What a cool suggestion. Thanks for sharing that, I think I'll be building one of those in the future.

That looks amazing! My biggest obstacle when trying to design a geodesic dome greenhouse is how to design and build the mounts for the transparent panels. I guess those mounts would be at an angle when using this construction method, but maybe that isn't a problem?

I know that some people "just" cover the dome with a large square of plastic film but that always ends up looking a bit undone.

Here is another alternative for super flexible geodesic dome joints: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/25645348/geo-the-geodesic-dome-connector?ref=profile_starred

You could probably use a captive nut designed joint, to make them stronger.  Look at some of the lasercut plywood 3d printers.  I'm thinking of my 2013ish printrbot LC.  I'll try and get some photos, when I am home.  Basically a hole in one piece and a cross shaped slot opposite.  The nut goes into the cross of the t and then the screw goes through the hole and it all locks up pretty tight.

If only I finished all my thoughts before posting... http://makezine.com/2012/04/13/cnc-panel-joinery-notebook/  has some great joints but I was specifically thinking of the one they talk about a little over half way down.

I keep thinking about this design. While I don't want a greenhouse at all, I can't get it out of my head.  Use polycarbonate sheet (either flat or twin-wall even) cut an set into the triangles. Probably also CNC shaped at least the flat stuff. Corrugated polycarbonate would be tricker.  I think you'd have to install cleats of some sort to hold it in the frames.  One of these days I'll get enough free time to start mocking this up in sketchup.   I like the idea of the isometric mesh from the first link, made into a sort of tunnel style greenhouse, or shed.

I very much want a greenhouse and yes, maybe cleats would be the right solution. The odd angles makes it less than obvious how to install flat panels onto this structure.

Here's what I'm planning to make and the reason for me getting a Maslow:

If it helps, those guys designed a dome system with cnc cut connectors, and random tubes : http://domenico.cc/

@littlevache Nice find! Thanks for sharing. The connectors are what I was looking for long time.

If you guys are looking for the frame work for a dome, you can use 2x4s and Starplates for the frame.
