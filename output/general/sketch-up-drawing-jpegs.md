## Sketch up drawing Jpegs
Posted on **2017-02-09 13:19:35** by **tjdux**:

Hey just curious if anyone with a few free minutes could post some Jpegs of the current sketch up drawing so that me, and any others who are doing this mostly on mobile devices can see the sketch without needing a computer with sketch up on it.  I know sketch up used to have a function to output screen shots as jpeg on the free version.   Nothing complex but maybe a front, side, top, and 3/4 front side view.   Thanks
