## Chain lengths

What length are the chains suppose to be? My motor to motor distance is 3100mm and during calibration they do not reach....

the chains are supposed to be 11', which would barely reach. but you can get a master link and join sections of chain together



your machine is noticeably wider than the standard one (which I believe will help your accuracy)

In the directions on the basic frame, it said to mount the arms at 45deg angle and ~20" away. Unfortunately, my chain is 10' long as that's the boxes they came in... May need a 3rd box (they come with links at least)

Yes, you do want just over 10' of chain or you run out when reaching to the far bottom corner.
