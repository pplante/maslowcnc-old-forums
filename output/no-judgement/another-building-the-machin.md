I am not very familiar yet with SketchUp, but I did find out how to open the design files and use the measure tool. I wanted to start cutting my 2x4s.. But is this the way to do it? Measure on the drawings and recreate from that, or am I missing a write-up of cuts and angles?

the write-up you are looking for hasn't been created yet

Yup, @davidlang is right. We're spending the next few days scrambling getting kits out the door. This week's update will come with more details about the assembly process. 



That being said, if you were to use the measure tool in sketchup and measure out the 2x4s and cut them that should work. We're working on a write-up so you don't have to go through all that trouble.
