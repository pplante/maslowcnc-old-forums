Hey folks!Looking for a pro tip! After the cut is complete and you have to remove your project from the plywood sheet, what is the best tool to cut the tabs smoothly so less sanding will have to be preformed later? Maybe an Oscillating Dremel? Looking to purchase what I need before maslow arrives :)
