## Installation Height?

How important is the exact angle it's sitting at? Could the angle be increased to lower the height by 6" or so? It would still be sitting mostly vertical I think but would obviously stick further out from the wall. But I'm curious if that's feasible and if it would impact the way it works. I've got a very low ceilinged basement space I'd love to set this up in. But it's only like 6'2" or so...



It sounds like I could also make the cutting area smaller but I'd rather still do 4x8 sheets if possible.

It sure looks like you could lower the whole thing by making the legs shorter, and not have to change the angle. The main reasons to place the sheet at eye level are that it's easier to watch it work that way, and until there's a Z-axis it keeps you from bending down a lot to change the bit height. If it's really low you might want to add some platforms under the motors to keep the chain loops from touching the floor... 

I'm planning to build my frame as low as possible just because I don't like having to lift 4x8 sheets so high to load them. I can see you'd want it about 6 inches off the floor to let the sled reach the bottom edge of the sheet, but I want to keep using the wall space above this for storage or other functions. A shorter A-frame would also stand out a little less from the wall.

Oh, duh. I don't know how I missed how far off the floor it is. I'll blame it being too early in the morning. Thanks!
