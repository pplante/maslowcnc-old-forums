Great question! I wish I could give you a better answer. Right now all I can really say is "as soon as possible" which is probably in the summer. Right now the #1 goal is get machines out to all of our kickstarter backers and support them. It's a little bit of a balancing act. On the one hand we want to get machines out to everyone who wants one, but at the same time we want to make sure we have the resources to support everyone who backed us on kickstarter. It's going to depend a lot on how smoothly getting everyone set up goes.  If it seems like things are going smoothly we can get the second batch started sooner, but if we need to slow things down to to do it right the first time around, we're definitely going to do that. My gut says batch two will be this summer.

The kickstarter campaign estimated May, it's not uncommon for projects to slip slightly, or for that estimate to be the delivery of the first units with it taking longer for all of them to be packaged and delivered.
