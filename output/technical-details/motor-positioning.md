## Motor Positioning

What is proper spacing of the motors from each other and from the material to be cut?  In other words how close can they be mounted to a 4' x 8' sheet?

The motors *can* be mounted in many configurations, however accuracy will suffer in (as yet not fully quantified) ways. The software takes into account a measured distance between the motors, but I think its safe to assume that the more narrow the motors are to the work surface the more likely you'll have inaccuracies. 

As I understand it, once one chain comes close to vertical on its near side you'll see larger problems. The 'standard' machine maintains the motors about 2' wide on each side of the work surface. (ie: total machine width = ~12' : 8'(worksurface) + 2'(port) + 2'(starboard)

you want the motors a foot or more above the surface and a foot or more outside the edge

wider/higher spacing helps many things.

play around with the simulators we have to get a rough idea of how things work.
