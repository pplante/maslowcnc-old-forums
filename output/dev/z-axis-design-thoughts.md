## Z Axis Design Thoughts

Ok, can't find Bar's post on his Z Axis trial cutting.  But I have been pondering it now a few days.  I don't think it is the right solution to go with, you are going to run into a lot of router designs that depth adjust differently.  On my Dewalt it is a dial on the fixed base.

I started sketching up a thought.  You don't "need" the fixed base, or any base for that matter.  What you need is just the spindle.  Your options for raising and lowering go up greatly when you bare it down.  What you just need to do is make Maslow's sled become the router base.

First I started sketching a design thought with a threaded rod and support rails to guide the spindle up and down.   Then I remembered [this](http://www.rockler.com/router-lift-fx) for lifting but that is a pricey option to make work.  Then finally it kicked in that I had the ideal solution to work with already in my "Home Made Workshop" book.  

A router lift that uses a threaded rod and drawer slides for stability.  Now it works top down like any router lift, but this being a home built design, it can be flipped arou nd so the adjustment is on the back side.  I broke out the {Router Lift](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AncWsnmIIFfongtcF9JqwNHZd6Pf) section of the book so it can be looked at.  If I can get enough free time I am going to see if I can come up with a design idea.
