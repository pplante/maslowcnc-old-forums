## Off the grid
Posted on **2017-06-23 10:54:09** by **Bar**:

Hey everyone! I just wanted to let you all know that I'm going to be properly off the grid this weekend so if I don't respond quickly, I'm not ignoring you, I'm just out in the woods. I figure after this weekend I probably won't have a chance to take a day off for a while as we get everyone up and running.

Have a great weekend everyone!

I second that "Thank you" for all the hard work. All of the work from Bar and all the forum contributors (both Beta and ones waiting for  systems) will make it easier for the non-beta systems like mine to get running quicker when it shows up. Enjoy your time off.
