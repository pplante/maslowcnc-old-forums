I am just extremely jealous of you all. So many ideas in my head especially with the z-axis. Just not smart enough to build one on my own and now I can't get one until production is up and running. Wondering if there is one close enough to me.

Mine's not here either, but my low backer # should be on the first truck

Just received mine in Green Bay. It will probably be some weeks until I can get started with it though.

Near Madison, Maslow hasn't arrived yet. I do have an xcarve if you have ideas that fit that platform.
