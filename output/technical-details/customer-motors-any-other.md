## Customer motors - any other things not available off-the-shelf?

Great work and awesome that you're open-sourcing this thing! In one of the videos you mention that you use custom motors. I was wondering if there are any other of the materials that are not readily available. Basically, I'm trying to find out what is stopping me from going out and buying the supplies today to build one.

"what is stopping me". Nothing. You might have to figure out how to interface it all, change firmware to support the different hardware, get PC boards made, etc. On the other hand your support of an open source Kickstarter campaign that includes the basics helps a fellow human being that is trying to make a living with basically a one shot idea. After the campaign is over I doubt Bar is going to get a ton more orders since this is open source. That being said :

I am not sure that they would have to be custom motors. I suppose you could get some off-the-shelf standard 12V geared motors with encoders like these : http://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-12V-Reversible-High-Torque-Turbo-Worm-Geared-Motor-Encoder-10-20-30-40-100RPM-/182326886308?var=&hash=item2a73877fa4:m:m_7kmvnPg_kfWUCuhfOX6bw
I suppose 10 or 20 rpm would work along with a standard 12volt supply.

Cheers! I've already contributed to the campaign but the long wait for the hardware made me hesitant to go "all the way" and order a kit :-). I was trying to figure out if I could go out and source the components today (potentially at a higher price) and start building the thing from scratch. There's some pretty heavy tax duties for having things shipped here to Denmark as well so the final price of the kit is a bit of an unknown for me :-(

I understand. Those taxes, customs fees, and shipping can really take up a chunk of change. Maybe Bar can make a deal.

Thomas; I`ve been thinking the same, I would like to make my own hardware, and have already found a couple of encoder motors on Ebay that could be used. Gear ratio and encoder pulses would have to be changed in the firmware, but that should be an easy task, at least according to Bar. The norwegian import taxes are even worse than the EU taxes you guys have, but if I stay below 350kr pr shipment the tax guys leave me alone :-) 

If you want to look at alternative components just give me a shout, maybe we can come up with something good that will benefit the entire community! :-)

Best regards
Asle, Oslo

Hi Asle, I can image it would be even worse to Norway! I must admit I've caved in an gone for the full kit. I'll have to deal with Told/SKAT (customs) when the time comes :-(

I'm still interested in seeing what it takes to build one from scratch but that might be easier once I have a working prototype. Very keen to drive this technology in Scandinavia so let's stay in touch! You can hit me at @tgkristensen on twitter if you want to.

Have you considered using wiper motors. Huge mass production means they are highly reliable and inexpensive. They are often used in diy robot projects. Next issue is low cost encoder. 

I suspect a simple optical system looking thru the chain would work with reasonable accuracy,

I did play around with the idea of using wiper motors. It turns out that it's not much more expensive to design a custom motor which does exactly what we need and the quality is higher.

Well I got my Ebay motors from my link above for playing around with while I wait for the "real deal". For starters these are pretty small and light weight. Not like the one that Bar shows in his "design" video. It looks to be smaller and not that great of quality. They also have a nylon worm gear which I suspect would not hold up to moving a large router around. At least not for very long. This might work for a table top Dremel tool driven design. On the plus side it does have its own shaft encoder. Something to play around with while we wait.
