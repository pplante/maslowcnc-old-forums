Hi, All!

Ah, the "General" Channel... if you're unsure where to post, this is the place for you. Don't worry, I'll move it where it belongs based on the criteria for each Channel and you'll find it in "My Feed" at the top wherever it lands.

Discussions about the Kickstarter campaign belong here, as does anything related to the Makesmith, the previous Kickstarter project from the Maslow team.

Project ideas and cool things you want to make with Maslow belong in the "Project Ideas" Channel and most technical questions belong in "Technical Details". If you want to modify your Maslow, that goes in "Modifications" and if you want the latest news about the state of Maslow as it will eventually ship to backers, that will be found in "Dev."

If I've moved one of your posts and you feel it's in the wrong place, drop me a private message and we'll talk it through!
