How long did it take to setup your machine and get through the calibration process?

Stopping at the temporary frame I would say 3 hours as the average I can't imagine faster than 90 minutes even if you knew what you were doing.

Then 2-3 hours to cut the final frame parts and another 90 minutes to 2 hours to setup the final frame. 

All of these estimates assume you have the best told for the job, most importantly an impact driver.  Screwing by hand, way way longer.

That is my guess, anyone faster than that?
