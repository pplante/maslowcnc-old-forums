## Drafting

I spent some serious money printing fortepiano drawings on plexiglass, 250x125cm,  where the printer makes a 1:1 effort, and accuracy doesn't suffer since this process is not something coming off a roll passing beneath a printing head, thus hugely inaccurate in the x axis; there is rather a full stationary sheet, and a vastly expensive thing moving to where printing is needed. However much one's dreams are fulfilled, the ink flakes off instantly, so one has to lay straight edges on the drawing and scratch lines, filing them in with felt marking pens, the result being permanent and accurate, given that the expensive template shows exactly where to scratch. Surely a g-code driven Maslow can at the very least drill points at each intersection, or even better, make fine engraved lines with an acute cutter, 0.25mm deep in the plexiglass, which I can then color in. Sounds very promising, for a third of what I paid for three drawings.

what sort of accuracy are you needing on your drawings? given that you consider a plotter with a roll passing below a printing head too inaccurate, I suspect the maslow will be as well.
