## Is there a free sharing website with cnc router designs?
Posted on *2017-01-05 05:33:07* by *rollandelliott*

I know there are websites with free 3-D printer files one can download and 3-D print is there something like this for CNC routers if not we should make one

Bar and I have discussed setting up a marketplace here for this purpose. The general idea is that designs are submitted, vetted first by /someone/ then posted in the marketplace for the users to rate/review. The marketplace would be a collection naturally curated by the users of the machine.

No timeline thus far and I'm sure Bar/Hannah/Tom are busy bees right now. Once beta testers start getting machines it will make more sense to start focusing on that.

The web design and marketing guy in me says you shouldn't build something under the Maslow brand or within its website. You're talking about something completely different than Maslow (it's a really cool CNC router, the marketplace is a collection of designs and plans, and a community). By mixing the two you're creating a conflicting image of the Maslow brand. You'll run the risk of watering down the brand. If, on the other hand, you keep Maslow the mechanical end you'll have the opportunity to build it as the leader in DIY CNC. 
For more on the topic I recommend checking out an old book: Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind. 
It's really old, but still very much applies to today.

I think Arduino, Raspberry and half a dozen open-source 3D printers, CNC's, laser cutters and rapid prototyping machines have followed a similar model, though. It's similar to Apple and Google where the software intended for the product is quality-checked for use on the platform. With regards to Ries/Trout, consider repositioning competing 4x8 machines as "pro-only" machines that require a lot of expertise while Maslow is simple to use. (This is one of Bar's goals; Maslow is easy to use). Also, the scenarios where line extension is a positive thing; CNC equipment is low-volume and the market for small, affordable units is crowded (albeit not at this size) and the advertising budget is nil. If people look for CNC designs and end up at Maslow, they're presented with a  machine, not just designs.

Actually the example you provide are perfect demonstrations of why it's a good idea to separate the two. Arduino and raspberry pi are known for their hardware. If you ask people what raspberry pi is (assuming the person has any awareness of it) they will exclaim, "it's a little, cheap computer!". The brand isn't known for its software (rather, the hardware that can load all sorts of software). Maslow would be no different. Create a separate site with plans, let it stand on its own legs. A separate site can still accomplish all the goals you identify. It can say, "plans designed for Maslow CNC", it can promote Maslow, and be vetted by pros. It just should do those things as a complimenting, separate site and not acting as an "add-on" to the Maslow brand (the Positioning book explains the concept of an "add-on", and makes a great case as to why it will hurt a brand in the long run).

Regardless of the marketing, way I'd love to see a marketplace that has a wider variety of CNC designs in one place. I really like the idea of them being rated and tested. Discussions would be nice too.

It seems like a separate site could have the advantage of appealing to a wider audience, including people with other CNC machines. This could make it bigger and better for everybody. Nobody seems to have filled this need yet.

You could have tags to make it easy to find things designed for Maslow CNC but it seems like most designs would be relatively universal. And we could seed it with lots of designs tested on the Maslow to make sure that's the clear front-runner in terms of what people see when they come to the site. :)

I think everyone is right :-)

I see a need for a really solid answer to the question "I put my machine together, now what?" and I think the answer is a curated set of projects which we have tested and which have clear instructions. 

I think there is also a need for a thingiverse type site which makes it easy for anyone to post any project files. 

I am absolutely going to add the former to our website as soon as possible and that is something that TheRiflesSpiral and I talked about. 

Building a fully featured project hosting site is something that I would love to help with, but I don't think I have the web development skills to really do a good job as the main person on that. If when the dust all settles nobody else has done one, I may give it a go just because I think it's something that should exist, but if someone else builds a website for that it would be awesome. It's a huge need that isn't being served really at all right now.

I love that approach. A curated set of projects is also less overwhelming so it's a much better place for new people to start. That makes perfect sense on this site.

But I do hope somebody comes up with the thingiverse-like site as well. And I hope it features lots of Maslow-friendly projects. :)

shaper origin is supposed to have a bunch of free project files but they are not shipping their hand held cnc router till next fall 9 months out.

There should be multiple categories of designs

1. unverified designs (the raw uploads)

2. verified fixed-dimension designs

3. verified parametric designs

in an ideal world, you should be able to input the thickness of your material, and dimensions of the final product and get the g-code to make it. This lets you build dollhouse furniture, normal furniture, or oversized furniture from the same design.

A very important thing to have in the system is what the license of the design is. Ideally we want designs that we are allowed to download, tweak, and then redistribute (including uploading modified versions of them), but designs that we are only allowed to download and use locally are better than nothing (but should be flagged as being restricted)

Another license feature I would not like to see is something saying that the designs are not allowed to be used for commercial use.

One license feature I am comfortable with the requiring attribution (leaving info in  the file that says who created it)

in other words, CC BY-SA should be the preferred license

I think any site should also have the option of paying for a good design if someone puts in a lot of time they should be rewarded for the efforts.   Having a financial motivation will make the site better 

forcing people to give away to ideas for free will lead to a crummy site with poor selection

---

Posted on *2017-01-06 13:34:08* by *davidlang*

having paid designs ends up translating into designs that can't be distributed or modified.

I disagree with the concept that people who give away designs are unable to produce desirable work.

---

Posted on *2017-01-06 17:11:45* by *rollandelliott*

it' s just common sense. designs that take a lot of labor to make can't be given away from free, because the generally population is mostly takers, not givers. Just like people can use free software or paid ones, the paid ones are generally better.
I disagree with the concept that you can produce my desings and make money off them without paying me for them.

Ah the classic debate between capitalism and altruism... We're not going to solve it here!

I'll point out that Maslow has made their designs fully public

Thingverse is full of free designs.

as for free software vs paid software, I see it very differently than you do. It may be that I am looking at a lower level than you are (infrastructure and Operating systems) where free software has almost completely eliminated the paid competition. The desktop OS and user software is one of the few places where paid software is extremely common (and even there, Chrome and Firefox are examples of free software making big inroads)

I agree that we aren't going to settle the argument here, but I thing that a community discussing modifications to a machine should be supporting designs that can also be modified rather than ones that you have to pay for and aren't allowed to modify.

I don't want to speak for Bar but I'm certain he intends any designs in the market place to be free and open-source. He hasn't mentioned licensing specifically but I think a Creative Commons BY-SA or similar makes sense.

David's point it totally valid; In our server environment at my last employer (enterprise-level... over 200 virtual host instances in dozens of physical servers) paid software was exceedingly rare. Big-ticket items were the virtualization environment and database. And that's it. OS, Networking, Sharing, Printing, etc, etc, etc was all handled with publicly-available distributions.

Now you can argue the hidden cost of free software (more skilled administrators, lack of formal support, etc) is a disadvantage but honestly, my experience with support and ease-of-use for paid software isn't much better. I get more help from forums like this one and message boards than I've ever got from a phone call to Oracle or Microsoft.

Ideally it should be both Free and paid together
 What really yank my chain is the people that want free stuff are typically the ones that never contribute anything

---

Posted on *2017-01-07 11:17:24* by *Bar*

I think it should be up to the creator to decide. I think different people have different motivations for designing things, and there are times when paying people for their work is important and times when giving things away for free is sustainable too. 

TheRiflesSpiral floated the idea of making a new forum channel to talk about all this stuff, which I think is a great idea. Does anyone have any suggestions for what to call the channel? I keep coming back to "intellectual property" but that sounds too legal.

One of the things I love about Thingiverse is that I know anything I see linked from there will be released under the same license and is not behind a pay wall. I feel that having mixed content will muddy the waters. If you separate the two drastically, it may as well be a separate site entirely. Just my 2 cents.

Posted on *2017-01-09 09:50:23* by *TheRiflesSpiral*

Maybe something like "Design Sharing"?

Been doing some exploring of Thingiverse, and found a fair bit of things related to CNC. Specifically there are "groups" that have CNC themes, which one presumes Maslow could have its own group. There does not seem to be a limitation on what kinds of files are allowed to be uploaded as a "thing".

If Thingiverse could be convinced to add a new "category" of "CNC" then it would be easier to find files related to CNC, and could potentially solve the problem of a place to find CNC designs. With some tweaks Thingiverse could probably support what I believe is being discussed here.

Here is a link dump of groups that are CNC themed or topically related:

great idea, but almost all of those links have zero maslow type flat files, mostly plastic 3d objects. only the 3rd one down has some files that maslow could actually cut.

Did some more investigation, and found an easy way to find SVG and DXF files using their "tag" API.

https://www.thingiverse.com/tag:svg
https://www.thingiverse.com/tag:dxf

They are not all appropriate for CNC (some laser and pen plotting files), but many do appear to be, and it means that at minimum the site supports these files.

Also there is the site https://obrary.com  I haven't looked into their submission policies just noticed that they exist.  If I get some free time tomorrow I'll see what I can find about their practices.  Right now it's a small collection and mostly focused on laser cut things.  But given the ratio of people with access to laser cutters to people with access to larger CNC cutters that's not surprising.

---

Posted on *2017-01-23 15:29:12* by *Bar*

Oh wow! I had no idea they existed. That might be exactly what we're looking for.

---

Posted on *2017-01-24 07:20:38* by *lthomas987*

I can't find a way to submit designs on the site.  Could be they're curating them and you have to go through the founders.  They might be scraping them from elsewhere, which is what it looks like they did with the beehives.  Their forums appear to be a bit dead too.  Last post was in 2016.  But they do look like what we've been talking about.

---

Posted on *2017-01-24 14:50:41* by *TheRiflesSpiral*

Their facebook page has an update from about 10 days ago... I wonder if they would be open to a partnership with the Maslow team.

---

Posted on *2017-01-25 09:00:35* by *Bar*

One way to find out. I'll reach out to them and get the conversation started

---

Scott from Obrary here.  

I'd be happy to add your CNC design.  If its one design, just send it to me and I'll create the listing (it a short, but manual process).  If its many designs, I can give access and instructions to someone in your community.

---

Posted on *2017-01-25 13:09:03* by *TheRiflesSpiral*

Hey! That was quick!

---

Posted on *2017-01-25 16:34:39* by *Bar*

Welcome Scott!

Do you think that a user interface to let anyone upload their designs is likely in the future or will Obrary always be a curated collection? Either way, its a fantastic project and thank you for contributing it to the world.
