I can't really tell from the pic, but it appears that there's a lot of chatter in that cut.  How clean is the cut?

I think a lot of what you are seeing is just the top layer of wood being ragged, a quick pass with sandpaper to knock that off would give a much more interesting picture

I need to figure out how to keep the sled true. When the bottom "turns", it throws the centerpoint of the router off. This was cut on a scrap piece of sandable plywood. Not very rigid.

SO COOL! 



A lot of that chatter is going to come from the feedback control system. If you watch the sprockets they don't move smoothly, but jump. That has to do with the way the PID loop is set up that I talked about in the video and it will go away very soon. As soon as I fix all the things that are preventing everyone from having awesome 'E's like that!

Thanks Bar! I'm really curious how clean of a cut is possible with this system.  I haven't had a chance to set mine up yet, but plan on making a YouTube video soon and am hoping that most of the issues that I've been seeing here will be cleared up by then.  No pressure! :)

One pass with 3/16" acrylic. "Forcing" the machine a little, to see what needs the most attention.

:-) Don't wait for me to make the video, it might take me a week or two to finish putting out all the fires and get back to really pushing the design forward. I want to focus on getting everyone up and running

to keep the sled from "turning", reduce the friction on the sled.



try sanding the bottom of the sled smooth, waxing the bottom of the sled, making it from a slipprier material.



try adding weight to the sled



try angling things so that the chains are closer to vertical.

+1 for everything @davidlang said I think that where the chains mount on the sled plays a significant role too.

---

Yes, I would expect the chain positioning on the sled to make a huge difference

To make the control system run smoother, it can help to calibrate the motors on the location where you are going to cut. That way each motor is calibrated for the tension it is really experiencing.

I've tried choosing the chain attachment point by holding the chains in my hands and looking at the sled. For my sled (the round one) and bricks, the third hole from the sled is most nearly vertical. I wonder, though - should I be trying to match the slope of the workspace instead? Would this affect friction?

That is a GREAT question which I don't have an answer for. I've been going for balanced also, but you might be right that the real goal is to match the slope. I think it would have an effect because it would shift the weight to either the top or bottom of the sled where a little drag causes the sled to rotate more.



Great thoughts!

I hear ya Bar.  I've been assuming that you'll be trying to put out fires over the next couple weeks and getting everyone up and running.  I'm likely going to be making a series of videos over time as the platform and knowledge of the platform evolves and gets better over time.  My initial video will likely just be a quick intro to Maslow, the setup, and first impressions.  But first, I need to figure out where this beast will live in my shop :)
