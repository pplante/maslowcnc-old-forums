## Surface planer

Do you think the accuracy of this would be sufficient to act as an oversized surface planer?

One of the projects on my list is to try out Maslow to smooth (not flatten) a huge chunk of Maple I've had for a while now. But it's a consistent thickness already, it just has saw marks all over it and a few checks from the drying process.



Using a bowl bit (or a bottom cleaning bit) in a 2hp router is sketchy, so I'm going to have to experiment with feed rates, etc.



I think it depends on what you mean by accuracy, though... certainly the x/y accuracy of around 0.5mm is plenty for a simple task like planing, which is just moving back and forth over the surface. But since Maslow isn't suspended over the piece like a traditional CNC, but instead rests on the piece, the consistency of the Z axis is going to be dependent on the surface already on your piece.



My plan was to make a 1/16" deep spacer for the top of the base of the router, set the bit depth to 1/16" and start the cut just above the piece. Then plan a path back and forth from top to bottom so when the t op area meets the already flattened area, it's resting on the spacer... hard to describe... I'll sketch it out tonight.

I would not expect the maslow to work as a surface planer because it rides on the surface of the material being cut.



Since the base is fairly large it will smooth things out a bit, but it's nothing close to what you would be able to do with a gantry based CNC

If I used a couple of 2x4s as guide rails, then I think it would plane anything that is narrower than the base.  But then the question is how thick of a piece could I work on?  Could I put a 4" thick slab of oak on there, or would that be too thick?

I recall Bar saying that Maslow would be tolerant of fairly thick materials but I can't find the thread at the moment. I want to say that the original post was about styrofoam? I'll keep looking.

If the sled could adjust it's height and level versus the desired cut, it might work. 4 more steppers/encoders and all the related toys though.
