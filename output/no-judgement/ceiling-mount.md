## Ceiling mount

Had a wild thought (things like this occur to people in tight spaces).



Anybody considered a ceiling mount? I'm in a garage, where I need to park a vehicle "most of the time".



Was thinking about having an extension of the frame that went a bit higher, have it hinged to a ceiling joist. Back the car out, fold down and let the bottom sit on the floor (or some legs or whatever works for height). When you're done, fold it up and latch it.



Crazy?

It sound like a very good idea. The top-bar configuration currently being used as the 'bootstrap' arrangement would make this easier to do.

Maybe these pics will give you ideas about how to mount the frame. I'm doing a hinged assembly, but mounted on a bench. If you have exposed ceiling joists that's drastically easier. Work with what you've got, and figure out how to hinge to it and then attach some sort of brace to hold the angle.

Mine isn't an 'active' hinge though. It just stays there. Its only purpose is to make varying the angle easy. Yours needs to be swung down to use, then stowed back up.

Yours is not quite as simple as attaching hinges to joists, because the frame has a 'thickness.' There needs to be a structure that descends, then the hinges are attached to that.

Totally doable.

Thanks, appreciate the thoughts. At least maybe I'm not crazy (well, at least not due to that idea, anyhow :-))

The way I have mounted the hinges on my wall base allows me to pull it up to the ceiling as well.

can you guys with hinged mounts do some testing with having it be steeper? how steep can you go before it starts having problems (not holding the workpiece down, becoming too tippy, or anything else)?

@davidlang I will love to, once my Beta-Kit is here. With the car jack I have quite a range to experiment with.

I will be following this thread intently as I plan to hinge mine to a vertical wall.  From what I measured from the part files of the frame, the angle is 20 degrees off vertical, which makes for about 30 inches from the wall at the base (according to the design that I am working on, not the freestanding design)  If that angle can be reduced to 15, or even 10 degrees, that saves me some space in the workshop that I don't have to clear out before using the Maslow.  

So looking forward to playing with it.

I’ve used my frame at a 10 degree angle with good results. These days it’s at about 17 degrees, only so I could more accurately do beta testing.
