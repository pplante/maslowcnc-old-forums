## Z axis install

Anything special needing to be done to get a new z axis up and running?  Any controller slot?  Any software update/reboot needed?



Got mine installed today, but it doesn't respond to manual input from Ground Control

Good question. It should plug into the middle port (between the left and right motors). To let the software it is plugged in click the z-axis on switch under the settings menu in Ground Control.
