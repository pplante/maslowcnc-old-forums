## Modified Stand V2
Posted on **2017-03-27 13:44:06** by **jknox**:

I started a new stand with simplicity and rigidity in mind, this is what I have so far:  [V2 Concept](../../images/dm/nH/dmnH_mk2preliminary.png.jpg) 



The entire sloping section can be built flat on the floor, just like framing a wall. Then you just lift it up, set the angle you want, and attach the rear legs (or attach it to a wall, bench, etc). It's mostly 2x4s, but the lowest horizontal member is a 2x6 so it sticks out far enough to support the work piece, and the top member is also a 2x6 for strength and to allow the motors to mount further forward on the frame.



As shown it would take:

(1) 2x6x10'

(1) 2x6x6'

(7) 2x4x6' (4 for legs, 2 cross members, 1 for 45 degree braces)

(1) 4x8 sheet of plywood (hidden for clarity)



FYI, I'd like to add the major hardware to the model (probably not nuts and bolts), is there somewhere with details of the parts in the kit? If not I would appreciate any pictures/sketches/dimensions/part numbers that anyone can provide. Thanks!

(I mean the angle brackets, motors, sprockets, etc)

hmm, I tried to comment earlier and the comment didn't show up :-(



I like this stand, it looks simpler to build and probably stronger. My only concern would be how the motors end up mounting to the arms

I was planning to use the same motor mount plate, or at least one similar, on top of the 2x6.

I really like your design, very similar to what I was planning, though I'm using aluminum, as I'm hoping to mount a DIY panel saw on the back side.

That's a great idea to use both sides of the stand, certainly would justify spending a little more money to beef up the frame!

The bricks stick down from the sled a fair bit. I've raised my stand by 10" so they don't hit the floor. Another mod would be to support the sled past the bottom of the 4'x8' work area, as it gets tippy when the center of gravity point nears the bottom edge.
