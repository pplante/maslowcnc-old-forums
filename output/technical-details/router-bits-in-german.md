## Router bits ...in german?
Posted on **2017-05-10 10:03:33** by **badaboomberlin**:

Hi everybody, after spending some days to find the information on how to translate english technical language in german, I thought it could have been a good idea to ask for help.. being italian doesn't help.. before getting dizzy again, 1/4 in. Up Spiral .. 14 inches is 1.4 inches? or 0,25 inch? and it refers to the bit diameter? And what about the other dimensions?  If there are german native speakers that's great! Up to know what i got is that Schaftfräser is the router bit 2flute is 2 Schneiden, up spiral is Zentrumschnitt.. To find what Bar recommended is turning into an epic battle.. Of course any help from the europe side is welcomed.. until now it looks like the more fitting option: https://www.cnc-kompakt.de/product_info.php?info=p6739_vhm-schaftfraeser-2z-kurz--altin-weldon-schaft.html Thanks Ale

1/4 inches is 0.25". Yes, this is the bit diameter. We say "one quarter".

It is .25 inches. The metric equivalent is 6mm router bit and it refers to the diameter. The other dimensions are not standard, but make sure your bit is long enough to cut through your wood.

The bit in the link seems like it might be a little short, but would probably work. Unfortunately I don't speak German, but this bit here: https://www.cnc-kompakt.de/product_info.php?info=p6735_schaftfraeser-2z-lang-weldon-schaft.html looks very similar to the ones I use. It comes in a 6mm version.

Super, thanks guys, you're saving hours of clueless surfing! Looking forward for Maslow to get on the other side of the ocean, and hopefully thank you back with nice projects!

Guten Abend. I have ordered 2 x 4mm and 2 x 5mm bits from dictum.com. It took them 3 parcels and ages to deliver, so terrible company, but the order might help.

Hi Gero, vielen Dank! Wow looks like you found some very high-emd bits, right? Do you mean to cut other kind of materials with those, or they are so expensive because of the european general higher price?

I think they are MAN, so hopefully worth their high price. I can take some pictures tonight what is printed on them. Perhaps this supplier has a high margin. Cutting 2 sides of a plywood with all kinds of test patterns has made my current bit dull already. I might keep the MAN for cutting a special workpiece.

Ok thanks for the info, I will also see if go at the beginning with a cheaper one for the tests, and having a better one for the end products.

Correction for MAN, it is not the company :-), it stands for (manuellen) Vorschub => manual push/feed

HAHA you got me! I thought after building trucks MAN was having an interest in router bits!

@Gero, thanks a lot for the tip of the latest shop - they were superquick to ship the bits!

@Gero another question you can help me with maybe?  I have to order proper (...thing in the picture) for the bits I bought - of course no way of finding in the manual of the router the german name of it: [WP_20170626_15_23_56_Pro](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:Hwxr:wp_20170626_15_23_56_pro.jpg.jpg)  [WP_20170626_15_24_03_Pro](//muut.com/u/maslowcnc/s3/:maslowcnc:5ySf:wp_20170626_15_24_03_pro.jpg.jpg)
