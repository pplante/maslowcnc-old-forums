We're packing up to head to Maker Faire tomorrow and so I've been practice cutting our 8' sign

Wow! Looks like a perfect circle, oh, yes, a nice sign also ;-)

On that topic, can anyone point me to a .svg of the Maslow logo?  I could trace an image, but I'm lazy. :-)

@jwolter0 Had that in mind for quite a while, but am obviously as lazy as you 8) It needs to be on the door of my Maslow room, but tracing it with Inkscape just did not fit in to my schedule till now. Thanks for the reminder.

Yea, first thing I saw was the nice circle on the far side!  Great sign!

A perfect circle thanks to your calibration routine Gero!



I'm happy to put the .svg up somewhere. Let me dig around a little and see where to put it that makes sense

I put it in the [gcode for testing](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/tree/master/gcodeForTesting) folder. Don't forget to post pictures if you cut it out! I can't think of anything cooler than seeing our logo made around the world.

> your calibration routine

haha... I am following GitHub every morning while sitting on the Throne and know the guys behind this.

Thanks for the .svg and with a scattered bit (thanks to china putting cement in plywood), somewhere on my test sheet, this (M) will appear and proudly be placed on the entrance to a fantastic machine.
