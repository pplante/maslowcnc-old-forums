## Whats is the difference between the temporary and final frames?
Posted on **2017-04-26 23:19:31** by **jfcampbell**:

I would like to get started building my frame so I can jump right in once I get my Maslow. Here are few questions, sorry if they are explained elsewhere. 
1. Can you explain why you call it a temporary frame? I would like to start building the final frame from the get go because less work.
2. How much of it is used in the final frame? 
3. What is the dimensional height of the final frame? I have half basement I would like to put Maslow in.
4. There is an error opening the temporary sled pdf file.
Thanks

The idea is that the maslow can help build itself. So you build a temporary frame (little more than attaching the motors to the corners of a piece of plywood) and then the machine is usable enough to cut the parts for the final machine.

If you have access to an existing CNC (shopbot for example), you can cut all the pieces on that.

There are also a number of people who have build frames that don't have the fancy curves and who build the sled separately and don't build a temporary frame at all.

For 4. Did you 'rightclick' and download? I think I read some issues with that. Use the green button to download all and take the files from there.

@gero, I got it to work when downloading all at once

the height of the final frame is in the ballpark of 6-7', you have the 4' workpiece , a space under it, and then a bit over a foot of additional height above the workpiece for the motor mounts. One of the alternate frame designs used 8' 2x4s for the vertical supports and it was taller than the standard design.

Thanks, plan B it is!

I'm sorry for the slow response! I wrote but I guess I didn't click reply or something because it's not here.

The goal of the temporary frame is just to make it possible to build the machine without needing to have other tools or special wood working skills. If you've got the tools, then I'd say build it however you want!

The some base criteria are that the motors be about 3000mm apart and that they be about 400mm above the top of the cutting area. The other important factor to keep in mind is that the chain should be kept in plane (it shouldn't bend in the direction it's not meant to bend).

Check out our Kickstarter update from 8 days ago which features some of the awesome frames people have built for inspiration!
