## CNC made Pool table?

How useful do you guys think a cnc would help in making a pool table?



Also I was thinking for the top table part where the pool balls go (and has to be totally level), could a bar top epoxy work as a self leveling material?

I would imagine it would be great for cutting the pockets spot on.  For the actual table, I would use 25mm mdf, maybe even doubled up fixed to a torsion style frame with adjustable feet on the legs to level it.

Thats really smart on the adjustable legs to level the table.

You could also use a thincrete (finishing concrete product). It is usually used for floors but could be useful here.

@Chauhuh would the thincrete help with the leveling?

For a pool table you need two things, level and dead flat.

If you use heavy mdf, you will be spoiling a perfectly flat surface by pouring levelling compound over it to achieve something very easily done with simple ready available feet.

I have used cement based compounds quite a lot in the construction industry, and while they are great for levelling a floor prior to tiling, I would not say that it is flat enough to play pool on. The cement based ones can develop pinholes as it dries. It is more for "over all" level, to take the worst out of a floor, than dead flat and level.

Plus if you move the table, you have to level it again anyway.

Properly supported, MDF is already flat enough for a pool table surface. It's not technically hard enough (dents could form) but I wouldn't try to add anything to the top to harden it.

I grew up with a '70s equivalent of a MDF pool table. Dents were an issue - don't let anyone "hammer" the lead ball down in the rack, a divot will form there. Also, be *very* careful about liquid spills. :)

you could try some melamine faced mdf

Just a thought but a cheap sheet of formica might be in order here. Would solve the moisture and could reduce dent propensity
