I will make a firmware version which does nothing at all except command both motors to move, that way we can be 100% sure that it is a software issue or a hardware issue.

Nevermind. I feel like an ass. I had the power in the wrong hole.

I've literally spent hours on that. It's a real problem, not your fault. The next version of the PCB will have an indication light next to the plug to show that power is connected in the same way there is a USB indicator light. For now I think it would be helpful to create a problem -> solution guide so I'll make one today.
