I'm glad this is a no judgement page!! Here's a little brain teaser ... it's a bit out there but it's just a bit of fun. 

"The Maslow team is Bar, Hannah and Tom. What should the name of the next team member be ?"

Cheers, Michael Owen

I would take a guess if I had the SLIGHTEST idea. I'm a wizard at physical/mechanical/visual problems, but not so much with purely mental puzzles. Sheldon? :)

I've been thinking that we should have contests where the prize is a trophy that you can download and build yourself. I think we might have our first winner ;-)
