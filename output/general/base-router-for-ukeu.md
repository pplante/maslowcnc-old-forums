## Base Router for UK/EU
Posted on **2017-03-23 05:51:16** by **carlosizsak**:

Hi all, we are very excited about the Maslow but not sure which base router will be best to purchase to use with it, based in UK or EU. I was also considering getting the recommended Ridgid from US and then a power convertor but not sure if these will work with a power tool. Any suggestions, comments, advice most welcome!

Thanks

Thanks! They don't seem to have a UK distributor... I wonder if it;s the same as the Triton as that is what appears when I google it and  I wonder what Z axis would work with this router then? :)

Hi Carlo, I am in the U.K also and need to find a router that works with the z axis, going to do some investigating, hopefully if I post some options here people maybe able to point out which ones look promising.

Hi Dan, thanks for message. I've been looking at this 

http://www.screwfix.com/p/triton-mof001-1400w-dual-mode-precision-plunge-router-240v/6768K?kpid=6768K&cm_mmc=Google-_-Product%2520Listing%2520Ads-_-Sales%2520Tracking-_-sales%2520tracking%2520url&gclid=CMCz7rXq89ICFYwQ0wodA5YPEg&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CI_Rnrbq89ICFRIW0wodj2cAvg

Is the most similar to the ridgid I can find but wonder what z axis would work with it...

I need to dig out a picture of the ridgid, is there one showing the z axis connected ?

you want a fixed base router, not a plunge router

This is plunge and fixed, isnt it?

Are you the David Lang author of from Zero to maker btw?

the pictures just show a plunge base.



I'm not the author of zero to maker. unfortunantly it's a fairly common name

Thanks David. In the description of the Triton it says "Easy to control and simple to adjust. Capable of switching from a conventional plunge router to a fixed-base mode router with rack and pinion height adjustment." so I suppose it is also a fixed base router and should be fine to use with Marlow... 

and in relation to book, it is really good anyway! recommended :)
