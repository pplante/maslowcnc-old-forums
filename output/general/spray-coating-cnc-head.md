## Spray coating CNC head

Would be possible to install a different head on to this CNC for spray coating? Such as this ultrasonic spray coating nozzle: http://www.mtixtl.com/Spray-nozzle-MSK-SP-01A.aspx

Yes, there is nothing about the sled that requires a router. The sled drags across the surface of the work area, though, so you would have to consider that. I've rigged various pens and pencils to the sled, and found that smearing is a concern with some media.

That nozzle, I guess, would work.  The sled isn't specific to a router.  

But, jesus christ, that ultrasonic sprayer is $5,000
