## Why kickstarter instead of crowdsupply?

I know that it's probably too late to change it, but I am interested in hearing whether you have a reason, didn't assess it, or what?

Crowdsupply has been pretty excellent at supporting open-source projects, they're a crowd-funding company that support open-source, so it would be nice if open-source could support it.

Not a deal breaker by any means, but maybe something to think about for future crowd-funding campaigns?

To be honest, 100% because I didn't know it existed. I just checked it out and it looks fantastic. 

I love the coming soon feature. That alone is a game changer.

I will be keeping them in mind for future projects. Thanks for pointing them out.
