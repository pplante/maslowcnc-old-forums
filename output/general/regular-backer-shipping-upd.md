## Regular backer shipping update?

I was curious when shipping would begin to the regular backers?  Any issues on your end receiving the needed parts?

That's a good idea, we've been focusing a lot on the beta testers in the updates, we'll do some better coverage of the regular shipping this week. 

The short version is that we haven't brought it up because things are proceeding relatively on schedule. We will likely end up shipping a week or two later than we originally planned since we shipped the beta kits a few weeks later than we wanted to. I don't want to rush the beta phase, the work our beta testers are doing is phenomenal.

As far as parts arriving, most of the parts are here. We got our big shipment of motors on Wednesday which was exciting. The Arduino shields will probably be the slowest part to arrive again.

We've also been working with a local non-profit which employs people with disabilities to help us get all the parts bagged and packaged. They have a staff and an ISO9000 production facility that does work for Boeing and other big companies which is going to be a huge help. 

Hannah has been doing an amazing job coordinating everything so I'll let her give a full update on Wednesday.
