## Spiral up cut or down cut?

Seems like down cut would make most sense to reduce tear out.  Thoughts/experiences?

The following is quoted from the Edge of Arlington CNC Manual:

"Up-cut spirals will aid in fast chip removal. When cutting all the way through the material, the up-cut will produce a smooth finish on the bottom but may fray or chip on the top, especially on entry into the material. Up-cut spirals are preferable when grooving, slotting or when fast chip removal is required, such as cutting soft plastics. Up-cut spirals will try to pull the material from the table so a good hold down system is very important. Up-cut spirals are not recommended when stacking material due to the tendency of the material to move. Down-cut spirals will force chips downward so a good dust collection is very important. Down-cut spirals can generally run at faster feed rates due to the downward pressure which helps to hold the material in place. When cutting all the way through the material, down-cut spirals will produce a smooth finish on the top but may fray or chip laminate on the bottom - back support such as a bleeder board will help to minimize tear-out. Down-cut spirals are often used to  cut dadoes and rabbits when a clean cut on top is needed. Down-cut spirals are preferred for hand-held operations, when material is being stacked and when cutting small pieces. Down-cut will tend to try and push the material around the table so a good hold down system is still very important."

I prefer up cut as the chips get removed easier. the downcuts force the chips down and can cause build up and jams,  I cut mostly plastic and aluminum so tear out doesn't really apply as much as it would with a material like wood. also 90% of the bits on aliexpress are upcuts, downcuts are harder to find.

I prefer spiral up cut bits because I feel like they pull the sled toward the work. Maybe not significantly, but it makes me feel good. Also like @rollandelliot said, they are more common
