## Missed opportunity!
Posted on *2017-06-05 17:31:34* by *chriskehn*

I saw a video last night demonstrating your product and thought, "Yes!" Well, when I went to your website today to pre order one of your kits it appeared I missed the boat. No!

So, if there is an issue with fulfilling future orders, would the creators of the Maslow be willing to let others know where they might be able to purchase identical hardware found in the kit? I'm sure there are a lot of talented people who may be able to create some nice craft but when it comes to programming a circuit board, that sounds a bit scary. ;)

Please forgive me if this information has already been provided on this forum.

Welcome, Chris!

"Identical" hardware isn't available as the motors and Arduino shields are parts made to specification for this project. (Custom)

However there are likely a number of suitable replacements that have slightly different but reasonably similar specifications. Since this is an open source project, everything you need to get started with your own build (sourcing your own hardware) can be found on github: https://github.com/MaslowCNC

The community will do its best to help you along the way.

We've also seen two beta testers sell their kits here so keep an eye out.

There was some selling theirs on the forum, search the past topics in the last couple weeks, or type sale in the search bar.  Good Luck
